# Formspec — Consolidated TODO

**Validated 2026-04-19.** Items #30, #31, #32 landed in the 2026-04-19 batch; #29 batch 1 (5 of 29 rules) landed alongside them. See "Resolved" section below and git log.

## Open

### 29. Graduate 29 draft lint rules with fixtures — 5 of 29 done
- **Progress (2026-04-19 batch 1)**: E200, E201, E301, E302, E710 graduated to `state: "tested"` with triggering fixtures under `tests/fixtures/lint/`. Rust emission sites for E200/E201/E302/E710 wrapped with `crate::metadata::with_metadata(...)`; E301 was already wrapped via `validate_path`. 13/13 registry tests green; 302 Rust lint tests green; 1985 Python tests green.
- **State**: 24 draft rules remain — E100, E400, E601, E602, E800–E807 (minus E805 which doesn't exist), W700–W703, W705–W709, W711, W801, W803, W804. `metadata_for(code)` still filters these out.
- **Sequencing**: `thoughts/research/2026-04-17-lint-rule-graduation-needs-fixtures.md` — next suggested batches: (2) FEL parse failure E400, (3) theme token value checks W700-series, (4) paired-artifact theme/component rules, (5) extension lifecycle E601/E602, (6) W803/W804 **only after** the Rust-vs-Python semantic divergence at `crates/formspec-lint/src/pass_component.rs:1133-1140` is resolved.
- **Files**: `tests/fixtures/lint/*.json` (new fixtures), `specs/lint-codes.json` (flip state + add fixture path), Rust emission sites as needed for `with_metadata` wrapping.
- **Done when**: every rule reaches `state: "tested"` with ≥1 fixture path that triggers the rule's code and matches its registry `specRef` / `suggestedFix`. `test_every_tested_rule_has_at_least_one_triggering_fixture` stays green throughout.

## Track / Monitor

### 14. `materializePagedLayout` — by design
- **Source**: editor/layout split review
- **File**: `packages/formspec-studio/src/workspaces/layout/LayoutCanvas.tsx:361-380`
- **Status**: Guarded by `useRef<boolean>` flag — no-op after first call. Negligible overhead.

### 19. Component tree reconciles on every dispatch
- **Source**: editor/layout split review
- **File**: `packages/formspec-core/src/raw-project.ts:350-373`
- **Action**: Monitor. Resolution path documented: add dirty flag. Not yet implemented.

### LayoutContainer dual-droppable
- **Source**: layout DnD review (2026-04-07)
- **File**: `packages/formspec-studio/src/workspaces/layout/LayoutContainer.tsx:194-209`
- **Status**: `useSortable` + `useDroppable(container-drop)` on same element. No code change until a mis-hit is reproduced.

## Resolved

<details>
<summary>Resolved 2026-04-19 batch (click to expand)</summary>

- **#30** — Changelog snake→camel boundary hardened. `generate_changelog` Python binding now accepts `wire_style="snake" | "camel"`; `change_to_object` in `crates/formspec-core/src/json_artifacts.rs` skips None for optional string fields so camel output matches `changelog.schema.json` directly. `_changelog_snake_to_camel` helper + 52 LOC of private allowlist deleted from `validate.py`. 8 new tests (5 Python, 3 Rust) pin the contract.
- **#31** — Release-pipeline scripts now have 22 tests across `scripts/tests/` (8 filter + 10 placement + 4 CLI subprocess). Scripts refactored to export pure `filterForTier` / `restoreFromScratch` / `checkPlacement` functions with CLI guards. CLI behavior preserved byte-for-byte.
- **#32** — Registry assertion at `tests/unit/test_lint_rule_registry.py` extracted into `_check_diagnostics_against_registry` that iterates all matching diagnostics instead of picking `matching[0]`. 5 new unit tests pin divergent-emission detection with per-emission locator.
- **#29 batch 1 / 6** — E200, E201, E301, E302, E710 graduated. 5 new fixtures under `tests/fixtures/lint/`, 4 Rust emission sites wrapped with `with_metadata`. 24 rules still draft; see Open #29.

<summary>Resolved 2026-04-17 parallel-craftsman batch (click to expand)</summary>

- **#22** — FEL trace bridge through WASM → Python → TS → MCP. 5 commits (`e72f9843`, `9a46698c`, `b890ec5c`, `edbe2ca3`, `058e385d`). New MCP tool `formspec_fel_trace` returns `TraceStep[]` byte-identical to Rust.
- **#23** — `benchmarks/run_mcp_loop.py`. Commit `a4b7dd1c`. Verified end-to-end: converged to `score=1.0 / validates=true` in one round on the invoice task.
- **#24** — Tier-split release pipeline with scripted partitioning + per-tier sequential CI. Commits `78f8fc7b`, `95912f6e`, `364d3a96`. Four-tier dry-run matches COMPAT.md membership.
- **#25** — CI gate verified (test already in `python-tests` job); 8 on-disk fixtures + generic registry-driven assertion (commit `42004918`). Replaces 3 hand-crafted per-rule tests.
- **#26** — 29 draft rules carry verified `specRef` + `suggestedFix` (commit `003cd229`). State intentionally stays `draft`; graduation tracked in item #29 above.
- **#27** — Changelog E100 fix: `$formspecChangelog` envelope marker in generator + snake→camel translation at lint boundary + 4 round-trip conformance tests + benchmark widening (commits `2e110a54`, `78f82b1b`, `81df0d6d`, `67685ecf`). `grant-report` benchmark validates clean on base + long + short.
- **#28** — ADR-0064 landed in earlier session (`2fe42175` + `7ec2093e`); submodule pointer already current.
