# E2E Test Strategy

Single source of truth for Formspec E2E test coverage: what's tested, how, and what remains.

## 1. Philosophy

The grant-application is the single integration fixture. It exercises the engine the way real
deployments will: a realistic multi-page wizard with repeatable groups, calculated subtotals feeding
a variable chain, shape rules at three severity levels with `activeWhen` and `context` expressions,
cross-field constraints, conditional visibility, and a full definition+component+theme stack.

Synthetic fixtures are kept only where the grant-application genuinely cannot serve: deeply nested
repeats (3+ levels), exhaustive FEL stdlib isolation, NaN coercion edge cases, types not present
in the grant-app (`uri`, `time`, `dateTime`), and the formal holistic conformance suite.

## 2. Test Architecture

### 2.1 Grant-Application Integration Tests

| Test File | Features Validated |
|---|---|
| `integration/grant-app-conformance.spec.ts` | Identity, hydration, mixed types, validation report contract, shapes, nonRelevantBehavior, display items |
| `integration/grant-app-validation.spec.ts` | Bind constraints, whitespace, constraint messages, shape logic (or/and/not), activeWhen, timing, context |
| `integration/grant-app-wizard-flow.spec.ts` | Wizard pages, child fields, instance data, field metadata (labels, semanticType, prePopulate), component rendering |
| `integration/grant-app-budget-calculations.spec.ts` | Reactive calcs, precision, money aggregation, conditional variables, structureVersion, minRepeat/maxRepeat |
| `integration/grant-app-data-types.spec.ts` | Money coercion/badge, multiChoice, attachment, date calc, readonly, initialValue, optionSet labels, defaultCurrency |
| `integration/grant-app-visibility-and-pruning.spec.ts` | Conditional visibility, relevance cascade, nonRelevantBehavior remove vs keep (form-level vs per-bind) |
| `integration/grant-app-discovered-issues.spec.ts` | Null constraint short-circuit, duration null handling, phase UI, repeat nesting |
| `smoke/kitchen-sink-smoke.spec.ts` | Wizard flow, field types, calculate, repeat add, variable reactivity, response contract |

### 2.2 Kept Synthetic Fixtures

| Test File / Fixture | Why Kept |
|---|---|
| `integration/nested-repeats-and-calculations.spec.ts` | 2-level nested repeatables (projectPhases → phaseTasks); grant-app has this but the test isolates the nesting specifically |
| `integration/fel-standard-library-ui.spec.ts` | FEL stdlib coverage for 40+ functions — purpose-built isolation |
| `integration/edge-case-behaviors.spec.ts` | NaN coercion, null × number stability — not realistic in grant context |
| `integration/kitchen-sink-holistic-conformance.spec.ts` | Formal conformance: all 13 dataTypes, TS/Python parity, instance injection, migrations |
| `components/*.spec.ts` | Component unit tests on minimal inline definitions (7 files) |
| `fixtures/kitchen-sink-holistic/` | Holistic conformance fixture |
| `fixtures/edge-cases.json` | NaN coercion fixture |
| `fixtures/fel-functions.json` | FEL stdlib fixture |
| `fixtures/data-types.json` | Types not in grant-app: `dateTime`, `uri`, `time` |

### 2.3 Deleted (Replaced by Grant-App Tests)

| Deleted File | Replaced By |
|---|---|
| `fixtures/shopping-cart.json` | grant-app-budget-calculations |
| `fixtures/repeating-sections.json` | grant-app-budget-calculations |
| `fixtures/validation.json` | grant-app-validation |
| `fixtures/static-validation.json` | grant-app-validation |
| `integration/calculation-visibility-submit.spec.ts` | grant-app-budget-calculations |
| `integration/repeating-sections-calculation.spec.ts` | grant-app-budget-calculations |
| `integration/cross-field-constraint-validation.spec.ts` | grant-app-validation |
| `integration/field-pattern-validation.spec.ts` | grant-app-validation |
| `integration/response-schema-contract.spec.ts` | grant-app-validation |
| `integration/response-pruning-behaviors.spec.ts` | grant-app-visibility-and-pruning |

### 2.4 Test Helper: `helpers/grant-app.ts`

All grant-app integration tests import from `tests/e2e/playwright/helpers/grant-app.ts`:

- `mountGrantApplication(page)` — loads definition + component + theme, waits for render
- `goToPage(page, title)` — navigates wizard to named page
- `engineValue(page, path)` / `engineSetValue(page, path, value)` — read/write field signals
- `engineVariable(page, name)` — read global variable (`variableSignals['#:name']`)
- `getValidationReport(page, mode)` — get validation report (continuous/submit/demand)
- `getResponse(page, mode)` — get response object
- `structureVersion(page)` — read structureVersion signal
- `addRepeatInstance(page, itemName)` — add a repeat row programmatically
- `getInstanceData(page)` — read instance data from engine

## 4. Grant-Application Feature Inventory

What the grant-application definition exercises (condensed).

**Data Types**: string, text, integer, decimal, date, choice, multiChoice, boolean, money, attachment, display item

**Structure**: Groups, top-level repeatables (subcontractors, projectPhases), nested repeatables (budget.lineItems, phaseTasks), child fields (orgType.orgSubType)

**Binds**: required (8+), relevant (3 conditional paths), calculate (duration, subtotal, taskCost), readonly (duration, subtotal, taskCost), constraint (EIN pattern, date range, email format), constraintMessage, whitespace (normalize, trim), default (orgType), initialValue (contactPhone), prefix ($), hint (6+ fields), precision (2), prePopulate (orgName), excludedValue (requestedAmount), disabledDisplay (duration)

**Variables**: totalDirect, indirectCosts (conditional on orgType), grandTotal, projectPhasesTotal — all using @variable FEL references, if/then/else, money arithmetic chains

**Shapes**: 7 shapes across 3 severity levels. Compositions: or, not, and. Features: activeWhen, context expressions, timing (continuous + submit)

**FEL Functions Exercised**: sum(), money()/moneyAmount()/moneyAdd(), dateDiff(), dateAdd(), matches(), contains(), length(), abs(), upper(), coalesce(), round(), year(), isNull(), not, string(), present()

**Presentation**: pageMode wizard (5 pages), defaultCurrency USD, labelPosition top, density comfortable, nonRelevantBehavior remove (form-level) + keep (per-bind)

**Engine APIs**: getResponse(), getValidationReport() (continuous + submit), variableSignals, structureVersion, instanceData, addRepeatInstance

## 6. Remaining Gaps

### Low-Impact (Acceptable)

| Feature | Current State | Why Acceptable |
|---|---|---|
| `default` bind (FEL expression) | Only holistic tests string defaults. Grant-app has `money(0, 'USD')` default on requestedAmount but no dedicated assertion it fires on load. | Covered implicitly via response tests — if the default breaks, the response changes. |
| Shape timing: `demand` | Only holistic fixture uses demand timing. Grant-app doesn't use it. | Demand is a niche timing mode. Holistic coverage is sufficient. |
| Shape severity: `info` UI rendering | Tested as part of validation report counts, no dedicated UI assertion for info-level display. | Info severity exists in the report; visual rendering is a component concern. |
| `formPresentation.labelPosition` / `density` | Set on grant-app definition, not specifically asserted. | These affect CSS layout. Visual regression testing would be more appropriate. |
| `derivedFrom` | Pure metadata property, no runtime behavior. | Schema tests validate acceptance. Pass-through property. |
| `extensions` (x- prefixed keys) | Pass-through on items and definition. Schema tests validate acceptance. | No runtime behavior to test E2E. |

### Deferred (Needs Dedicated Fixture or Approach)

| Feature | Severity | Why Deferred |
|---|---|---|
| Theme selector cascade (Level 2 selectors) | Medium | Requires a theme-focused test with non-trivial selectors. Grant-app theme is too simple. |
| Theme null suppression (`"none"` sentinel) | Low-Medium | Specific suppression mechanism for inherited theme values. Needs theme-focused test. |
| `$ref` / `keyPrefix` composition | Low-Medium | Requires external definition fragments and the assembler. Grant-app is a single file. Holistic covers the basic case. |
| `prePopulate` runtime resolution | Medium | Definition property is present and tested. Verifying actual pre-population at runtime requires host injection or a mock data source. |
| Dependency cycle detection | Medium-High | Unit-test-shaped: engine throws on invalid input. Not an E2E concern. Covered by Python unit tests. |
| FEL: `countWhere()` | Low | Niche aggregate function. Covered by Python unit tests. |
| FEL: `relevant()`, `required()`, `readonly()` | Low | MIP state functions require FEL expressions that read MIP state — fundamentally a unit-test domain. |

### Out of Scope for Grant-Application (Covered Elsewhere)

| Feature | Where Covered |
|---|---|
| Deeply nested repeats (3+ levels) | `nested-repeats-and-calculations.spec.ts` (2 levels; 3+ not in any fixture) |
| Exhaustive FEL stdlib (40+ functions) | `fel-standard-library-ui.spec.ts` |
| NaN/edge-case coercion | `edge-case-behaviors.spec.ts` |
| `screener` routing | Not used in grant-app; holistic conformance covers |
| `remoteOptions` | `remote-options-binding.spec.ts` (dedicated mock) |
| `uri`, `time`, `dateTime` data types | Holistic conformance fixture |
| Component unit tests (Slider, Rating, etc.) | `components/progressive-component-rendering.spec.ts` and other component files |
| Custom component registry + cycle detection | `accessibility-responsive-custom-components.spec.ts` |
| Responsive design (breakpoints) | `accessibility-responsive-custom-components.spec.ts` |
