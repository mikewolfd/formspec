# Core Specification Reference Map

> specs/core/spec.md -- 4631 lines, ~218K -- Tier 1: Definition, FEL, Validation, Versioning

## Overview

The Core Specification defines the complete data model, expression language, validation system, and versioning semantics for Formspec -- a JSON-native declarative form standard. It covers what data is collected (Items), how that data behaves (Binds, Shapes, FEL expressions), and how validation results and responses are structured. This is Tier 1 of the three-tier architecture; it explicitly excludes rendering/presentation (Tier 2: Theme, Tier 3: Components) while providing optional advisory presentation hints.

| Section | Heading | Description | Key Concepts | Consult When |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Abstract | Abstract | Defines Formspec as a format-agnostic, JSON-native standard for declarative form definition and validation, independent of rendering technology. Draws on XForms, SHACL, and FHIR R5. | JSON-native, renderer-agnostic, self-contained definition | Understanding what Formspec is and its design heritage |
| Status | Status of This Document | Draft specification disclaimer; not yet submitted to any standards body. | draft, unstable | Determining spec maturity |
| Conventions | Conventions and Terminology | RFC 2119 keyword definitions and key term glossary (conformant processor, definition document, normative, informative). | MUST/SHOULD/MAY, conformant processor, definition document | Interpreting normative language in the spec |
| S1 | 1. Introduction | High-level introduction to Formspec's purpose and positioning. | -- | Orienting to the spec |
| S1.1 | 1.1 Motivation | Explains why Formspec exists: JSON ecosystem lacks a coherent form standard equivalent to what XForms provided for XML.

| S1.2 | 1.2 Design Principles | Seven prioritized design principles (AD-01 through AD-07): schema is data, separate structure/behavior/presentation, JSON-native, language-agnostic, layered complexity, extensible without forking, structured validation. | AD-01..AD-07, three-layer separation, layered complexity | Resolving design tradeoffs or understanding "why" decisions |
| S1.3 | 1.3 Scope | Defines what the spec covers (Definition schema, Response schema, FEL, processing model, validation results, extension points) and explicitly excludes (rendering, transport, auth, storage, non-JSON serialization). | in-scope vs out-of-scope | Determining if something falls within the core spec |
| S1.4 | 1.4 Conformance | Two conformance tiers: Core (parse definitions, all data types, all bind MIPs, full FEL, shapes, processing model, identity/versioning, option sets, cycle detection) and Extended (extensions, screener routing, composition, migration, pre-population). | Core conformance, Extended conformance | Implementing a conformant processor; understanding minimum requirements |

| S1.4.3 | 1.4.3 Conformance Prohibitions | Three things a conformant processor MUST NOT do: silently substitute versions, validate non-relevant fields, block persistence based on validation state. | VP-01 (pinning), non-relevant exemption, VE-05 (save never blocked) | Avoiding conformance violations |

### Conceptual Model (Lines 193-941)

| Section | Heading | Description | Key Concepts | Consult When |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| S2 | 2. Conceptual Model | Introduces the six core abstractions and their relationships. | Definition, Instance, Item, Bind, Shape, Response | Getting the big picture of the data model |
| S2.1 | 2.1 Core Abstractions | Overview of the six abstractions that form the foundation of the spec. | six abstractions | Understanding the conceptual architecture |
| S2.1.1 | 2.1.1 Definition | The complete, versioned form specification. Contains identity (url+version), items, binds, data sources, shapes, metadata. Identity tuple `(url, version)` is globally unique and immutable. | Definition, url, version, identity tuple, `$formspec` | Creating or parsing a Definition document |
| S2.1.2 | 2.1.2 Instance | A JSON object mirroring the Definition's item tree. Contains current field values. Supports primary instance (`$primary`) and named secondary instances (read-only reference data). Mapping rules: field->scalar, non-repeatable group->object, repeatable group->array, display->nothing. | primary instance, secondary instance, instance mirroring rules | Understanding how item trees map to data structures |
| S2.1.3 | 2.1.3 Item | A node in the Definition's structural tree. Three types: `field` (data value), `group` (container, optionally repeatable), `display` (read-only presentational). Fields require `dataType`. Full data type table with 13 types including `money`. Key must match `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`. | field, group, display, dataType, key, string/text/integer/decimal/boolean/date/dateTime/time/uri/attachment/choice/multiChoice/money | Defining items; understanding data type semantics and JSON representations |
| S2.1.4 | 2.1.4 Bind | Behavioral declaration attached to data nodes by path. Six bind properties: `calculate`, `relevant`, `required`, `readonly`, `constraint`, `default`. Binds are evaluated reactively when dependencies change. | calculate, relevant, required, readonly, constraint, default, reactive evaluation | Implementing reactive form behavior; understanding bind MIPs |
| S2.1.5 | 2.1.5 Validation Shape | Named, composable validation rule set (borrowed from SHACL). Requires `id`, `target`, `message`. Supports `constraint` (FEL expression) and composition operators (`and`, `or`, `not`, `xone`). Produces structured ValidationResult entries. | Shape, id, target, constraint, and/or/not/xone, ValidationResult, severity | Implementing cross-field validation; composing validation rules |
| S2.1.6 | 2.1.6 Response | A completed or in-progress instance pinned to a specific Definition version. Contains `definitionUrl`, `definitionVersion`, `status` (in-progress/completed/amended/stopped), `authored`, `data`, optional `author`, `subject`, `validationResults`. A Response with error-severity results MUST NOT be marked completed. | Response, definitionUrl, definitionVersion, status lifecycle, authored, VE-05 (save never blocked) | Creating or validating Response documents; understanding the response lifecycle |
| S2.1.7 | 2.1.7 Data Source | Declaration making external/supplemental data available to FEL at runtime. Three mechanisms: inline `data`, URL `source`, host function (`formspec-fn:` URI). Secondary instances are read-only; calculate binds MUST NOT target them. | Data Source, secondary instance, inline data, URL source, formspec-fn:, read-only | Configuring external data sources; understanding @instance() references |
| S2.2 | 2.2 Relationships | Formal relationship constraints between the six abstractions. Six rules governing how Definitions, Items, Binds, Shapes, Responses, and Instances relate. | relationship constraints, path resolution | Validating structural integrity of a Definition |
| S2.3 | 2.3 The Three Layers | Strict three-layer separation: Structure (Items -- what data), Behavior (Binds+Shapes -- how data behaves), Presentation (how displayed -- advisory hints only, out of scope). | Structure layer, Behavior layer, Presentation layer, three-layer invariant | Understanding architectural boundaries; determining where something belongs |
| S2.3 (L1) | Layer 1: Structure Layer | Defines WHAT data is collected: item tree, data types, repeatability, options, labels. Pure schema with no logic. | item tree, data types | Understanding the structural foundation |
| S2.3 (L2) | Layer 2: Behavior Layer | Defines HOW data behaves: computed values, conditional visibility, dynamic required/readonly, constraints, shapes, defaults. All expressed in FEL. MUST NOT contain rendering instructions. | reactive behavior, FEL expressions | Implementing form logic |
| S2.3 (L3) | Layer 3: Presentation Layer | Defines HOW data is displayed. Optional advisory hints only. Full rendering is out of scope; Theme spec (Tier 2) and Component spec (Tier 3) extend this. | presentation hints, advisory, Theme spec, Component spec | Understanding presentation tier boundaries |
| S2.4 | 2.4 Processing Model | Four-phase processing cycle (adapted from XForms): Rebuild, Recalculate, Revalidate, Notify. MUST execute in order. Includes deferred processing for batch operations. Presentation hints do NOT participate in the cycle. | Rebuild, Recalculate, Revalidate, Notify, four-phase cycle, deferred processing | Implementing the reactive engine; understanding evaluation order |
| S2.4 (Ph1) | Phase 1: Rebuild | Triggered by structural changes (repeat add/remove, definition replacement). Re-indexes items, reconstructs dependency DAG, validates acyclicity. | rebuild, dependency graph, DAG, cycle detection | Handling repeat instance changes; understanding when rebuild fires |
| S2.4 (Ph2) | Phase 2: Recalculate | Triggered by value changes. Identifies dirty nodes, computes affected subgraph (transitive closure), topologically sorts, evaluates calculate/relevant/required/readonly in order. Minimal recalculation guarantee. Iterates until stable (min 100 iterations). | dirty nodes, affected subgraph, topological sort, minimal recalculation | Implementing incremental re-evaluation; understanding calculation cascades |
| S2.4 (Ph3) | Phase 3: Revalidate | Triggered after recalculate. Evaluates constraint binds, required checks, and shape constraints for affected nodes. Composed shapes evaluated via composition operators. | revalidate, constraint evaluation, shape evaluation | Implementing the validation pipeline |
| S2.4 (Ph4) | Phase 4: Notify | Triggered after revalidate. Signals state changes to presentation layer/observers: changed values, changed MIP states, changed validation states. Mechanism is implementation-defined. | notify, state change signals | Connecting the engine to a UI layer |
| S2.4 (Def) | Deferred Processing | During batch operations, accumulate writes, defer all four phases until batch ends, then run one complete cycle. Final state must be identical regardless of individual vs batch processing. | batch operations, deferred evaluation | Implementing bulk data loading or import |
| S2.4 (Pres) | Presentation Hints and Processing | Presentation/formPresentation are metadata only. They do NOT participate in the processing cycle. FEL MUST NOT reference presentation properties. Presentation MUST NOT appear in Response data. | presentation isolation | Ensuring presentation doesn't leak into behavior |
| S2.5 | 2.5 Validation Results | Defines the structured ValidationResult data structure. Not boolean pass/fail -- structured JSON with severity, path, message, constraintKind, code. | ValidationResult, structured validation | Understanding validation output format |
| S2.5.1 | 2.5.1 ValidationResult Entry | Full property table: severity, path, message, constraintKind (required/type/cardinality/constraint/shape/external), code, source, shapeId, constraint. Seven standard built-in codes: REQUIRED, TYPE_MISMATCH, MIN_REPEAT, MAX_REPEAT, CONSTRAINT_FAILED, SHAPE_FAILED, EXTERNAL_FAILED. | ValidationResult properties, constraintKind enum, standard codes | Producing or consuming validation results |
| S2.5.2 | 2.5.2 Severity Levels | Three levels: error (blocks completion), warning (advisory), info (informational). Strictly ordered: error > warning > info. MUST distinguish all three in output. | error, warning, info, severity ordering | Implementing severity-based filtering; understanding submission blocking |
| S2.5.3 | 2.5.3 Aggregated Validation State | Derived state: "invalid" (has errors), "valid-with-warnings" (no errors, has warnings), "valid" (no errors or warnings). | aggregated state | Summarizing validation status |
| S2.5.4 | 2.5.4 Non-Relevant Fields | Non-relevant fields MUST NOT produce ValidationResult entries. Previously-emitted results MUST be removed when field becomes non-relevant. Re-relevant fields must be re-evaluated. | non-relevant validation suppression | Handling relevance transitions in the validation pipeline |

| S3.8.2 | 3.8.2 Functions with Special Null Handling | Lists 20+ functions that override the general null propagation rule (coalesce, empty, present, isNull, typeOf, count, sum, avg, min, max, ??, string(null), boolean(null), number(null), date(null), length(null)). | special null handling exceptions | Understanding which functions handle null specially |
| S3.8.3 | 3.8.3 Missing Field References | Existing field with no value resolves to null. Non-existent field key is a definition error (static check at load time, not runtime). | missing reference = null, undefined reference = definition error | Distinguishing runtime null from definition errors |
| S3.9 | 3.9 Element-Wise Array Operations | When arithmetic/comparison/string operators are applied to two equal-length arrays, the operation is element-wise. Mismatched lengths = error. Scalar + array = broadcast. Null elements propagate per-position. | element-wise operations, scalar broadcast, array arithmetic | Computing derived values across repeat collections before aggregation |

| S3.10.2 | 3.10.2 Evaluation Errors | Runtime errors: type error, division by zero, index out of bounds, date overflow, regex error. All produce null + diagnostic (not surfaced to end users). Rationale: form users should not be punished for author mistakes. | type error -> null, diagnostic recording, graceful degradation | Implementing runtime error handling in FEL evaluation |
| S3.11 | 3.11 Reserved Words | `and`, `or`, `not`, `in`, `true`, `false`, `null`. Plus all built-in function names in the function namespace. | reserved words | Choosing field keys and extension function names |
| S3.12 | 3.12 Extension Functions | Domain-specific extensions may register additional FEL functions. Must not collide with built-ins, must be pure, total, and declare signatures. Definitions SHOULD declare used extensions in `extensions` array. | extension functions, pure, total, signature declaration | Extending FEL with domain-specific functions |

## Critical Behavioral Rules

These are the non-obvious rules that trip up implementers:

1. **Null propagation defaults differ by context (S3.8.1).** In `relevant` context, null -> true (field stays visible). In `required` context, null -> false (field not required). In `constraint` context, null -> true (constraint passes). In `if()` condition, null -> evaluation error. These asymmetric defaults are the single most common source of confusion.

2. **`relevant` inherits via AND; `readonly` inherits via OR; `required` does NOT inherit (S4.3.2).** A child cannot be relevant if its parent is not. A child cannot be editable if its parent is readonly. But a required parent does NOT make children required.

3. **Non-relevant fields: calculate binds STILL evaluate (S5.6 rule 4).** Calculated values exist in the in-memory model even when non-relevant. The `excludedValue` bind property controls what downstream expressions see ("preserve" = last value, "null" = null). Submission behavior is controlled separately by `nonRelevantBehavior`.

4. **Saving MUST NEVER be blocked by validation (VE-05, S5.5).** Only the transition to "completed" status requires zero error-level results. In-progress responses with errors can always be saved.

5. **Response pinning is absolute (VP-01, S6.4).** A Response is always validated against its pinned version, even if a newer version exists. Active definitions are immutable (VP-02).

6. **Empty string and null are NOT the same (S3.4.3).** `null` = value absent (never set). `''` = value present but empty. `required` treats both as unsatisfied, but in all other contexts they differ.

7. **FEL has NO implicit type coercion (S3.4.3).** `0` is not `false`, `''` is not `false`, `null` is not `false`. Only `false` is `false`. Arithmetic requires numbers, `&` requires strings, logical operators require booleans. Use explicit cast functions.

8. **`&` is string concatenation, NOT `+` (S3.3).** The `+` operator is strictly numeric addition. String concatenation uses `&` to prevent ambiguity.

9. **Element-wise array operations with broadcast (S3.9).** Two equal-length arrays: element-wise. Different lengths: error. Scalar + array: scalar is broadcast. This is how `sum($items[*].qty * $items[*].price)` works.

10. **Division by zero produces null, not Infinity/NaN (S3.3, S3.10.2).** All evaluation errors produce null + diagnostic. The form keeps working; authors see the diagnostic.

11. **Bind paths use `[*]` wildcards; ValidationResult paths use concrete indexes (S4.3.3).** FieldRef syntax (definition-time) vs resolved instance paths (runtime). Never mix them.

12. **`key` must be globally unique across the entire Definition, not just among siblings (S4.2.1).** This is stricter than many expect.

13. **Processing model phases MUST execute in order: Rebuild -> Recalculate -> Revalidate -> Notify (S2.4).** Recalculate iterates until stable (min 100 iterations). Only the affected subgraph is re-evaluated (minimal recalculation guarantee).

14. **Shape composition operators can take inline FEL expressions, not just shape id references (S5.2.2).** An `or` array can contain `["present($email)", "present($phone)"]` directly.

15. **`initialValue` with `=` prefix is a one-time FEL expression; `calculate` is continuously reactive (S4.2.3, S4.5.2).** `initialValue: "=today()"` evaluates once at creation. A calculate bind re-evaluates whenever dependencies change.

16. **`default` on a Bind applies on non-relevant -> relevant transitions, not at initial creation (S4.3.1).** `initialValue` is for creation time. `default` is for re-relevance.

17. **Screener items are NOT part of the form's instance data (S4.7).** They exist only for routing purposes and have their own isolated bind scope.

18. **`nonRelevantBehavior` controls serialized output; `excludedValue` controls the in-memory evaluation model (S4.3.1).** These are independent concerns. You can have `excludedValue: "null"` (expressions see null) with `nonRelevantBehavior: "keep"` (response keeps the value).

19. **`optionSet` takes precedence over `options` when both are present on a field (S4.2.3).** The named reference wins.

20. **Whitespace normalization (`whitespace` bind property) is applied BEFORE the value is stored and BEFORE any constraint/type validation (S4.3.1).** Integer and decimal fields always get whitespace trimmed regardless of this setting.
