# Respondent Ledger Add-On Specification v0.2

**Status:** Draft  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-15  
**Audience:** Formspec add-on editors, platform engineers, runtime implementers, trust/compliance reviewers  
**Normative language:** The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 / RFC 8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines an **optional, respondent-facing audit change tracking ledger** for Formspec-based systems.

The ledger is designed for the **people filling out forms**. It records the material history of a draft, submission, reopening, amendment, or abandonment flow without changing the core Formspec `Response` contract.

This add-on exists to answer questions such as:

- what materially changed between draft saves,
- what changed after a completed submission was reopened,
- which values were user-entered versus prepopulated or system-derived,
- which validation findings were present when the respondent saved or tried to submit,
- and whether the recorded history can be verified later for support, appeals, dispute handling, downstream assurance, or identity-sensitive review flows.

This specification is intentionally **layered on top of** Formspec core. It reaches down into base Formspec semantics such as response pinning, item keys, response paths, validation snapshots, migrations, non-relevant behavior, and extensions; however, it does **not** redefine `Response` as an event stream and does **not** require every Formspec processor to implement the ledger.

---

## 2. Relationship to Formspec core

### 2.1 Layering model

A conforming implementation using this add-on works across three distinct layers:

1. **Definition** — the structural and behavioral meaning of the form.
2. **Response** — the current saved or submitted state of the respondent's answers, pinned to one exact `(definitionUrl, definitionVersion)` tuple.
3. **Respondent Ledger** — an append-only history of material respondent-side events that explain how the `Response` reached its current state.

### 2.2 What remains canonical

The `Response` remains the canonical state snapshot for the current answer set. The ledger is explanatory history, not a replacement source of truth.

A processor implementing this add-on:

- **MUST** continue to treat the pinned Formspec `Response` as the canonical submission payload,
- **MUST NOT** require ledger replay in order to interpret a valid `Response`,
- **MUST NOT** redefine core Formspec validation, relevance, calculation, or completion semantics,
- **MAY** use the ledger to support audit UI, dispute review, amendment flows, or forensic reconstruction.

### 2.3 Optionality and conformance boundary

This is a companion specification. A processor can be fully conformant to Formspec core without implementing anything in this document.

A processor that claims conformance to this add-on:

- **MUST** produce or preserve ledger documents according to this specification,
- **MUST** keep ledger semantics additive to Formspec core,
- **SHOULD** expose an implementation-specific discovery mechanism linking a `Response` to its ledger,
- **MAY** embed that discovery pointer in `Response.extensions`, provided the extension does not alter core semantics.

Recommended extension pointer shape:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "x-respondentLedger": {
      "ledgerId": "ledger-018f6f2f",
      "specVersion": "0.1",
      "href": "https://example.gov/audit/respondent-ledgers/ledger-018f6f2f"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2.4 Legal sufficiency

Ledger integrity, event chaining, and checkpoint anchoring contribute to evidentiary quality but do not, by themselves, guarantee legal admissibility in any particular jurisdiction. Implementations **MUST NOT** imply that ledger integrity alone is sufficient for legal admissibility. Implementations **MAY** make stronger evidentiary claims only to the extent supported by declared process, authored signature semantics, records-management practice, and applicable law — and **MUST** disclose which of those conditions they rely on when making such claims.

---

## 3. Design goals and non-goals

### 3.1 Goals

This add-on is intended to be:

- **Optional** — not every processor must implement it.
- **Append-only** — history is preserved rather than overwritten.
- **Material** — it captures meaningful state changes rather than UI noise.
- **Path-native** — change entries align with Formspec response paths and stable item keys.
- **Portable** — the data model can travel with the response or be stored externally.
- **Identity-portable** — identity, proof-of-personhood, and delegated-access facts can be represented through stable provider-neutral references rather than hard-coded vendor shapes.
- **Tier-aware disclosure** — one canonical event model can support anonymous, pseudonymous, identified, and fully disclosed review contexts without reshaping the ledger.
- **Identity-decoupled** — response storage, audit storage, and even on-chain anchoring can remain anonymous or pseudonymous while identity proofing stays in a separate but compatible framework.
- **Privacy-bounded** — implementations can retain proofs of change without retaining every prior sensitive value.
- **Human-legible first** — the first payoff is understandable respondent history.
- **Integrity-ready** — cryptographic sealing and platform-ledger anchoring can be layered on without changing event meaning.

### 3.2 Non-goals

This specification does **not** require:

- keystroke-by-keystroke capture,
- focus/blur or rendering telemetry,
- a particular storage engine,
- a particular cryptographic algorithm,
- studio-author change tracking,
- reviewer workflow history,
- or a mandated user interface.

---

## 4. Core model

### 4.1 Top-level document

A ledger document represents the material respondent-side history for one logical intake record.

Each ledger document **MUST** correspond to exactly one current `responseId`.

A ledger document **MAY** cover one or more session segments over the life of that response, including amendment cycles.

### 4.2 Canonical objects

This specification defines four primary object types:

1. `RespondentLedger`
2. `RespondentLedgerEvent`
3. `ChangeSetEntry`
4. `LedgerCheckpoint`

These names are canonical for this specification even if an implementation stores them in different physical tables or streams.

---

## 5. RespondentLedger object

### 5.1 Required fields

A `RespondentLedger` object **MUST** contain at least:

- `ledgerId`
- `$formspecRespondentLedger`
- `responseId`
- `definitionUrl`
- `definitionVersion`
- `status`
- `createdAt`
- `lastEventAt`
- `eventCount`

### 5.2 Recommended fields

A `RespondentLedger` object **SHOULD** also include, where available:

- `organizationId`
- `environment`
- `currentResponseHash`
- `currentResponseAuthored`
- `headEventId`
- `sessionRefs`
- `checkpointRefs`
- `extensions`

### 5.3 Field semantics

- `ledgerId` — stable identifier for the ledger document.
- `$formspecRespondentLedger` — add-on specification version string.
- `responseId` — identifier of the current Formspec `Response` this ledger describes.
- `definitionUrl` and `definitionVersion` — the exact Formspec definition identity currently associated with the response.
- `status` — current ledger status, typically aligned to the latest response lifecycle state.
- `createdAt` — timestamp of the first event recorded in the ledger.
- `lastEventAt` — timestamp of the most recent event in the ledger.
- `eventCount` — total number of retained events.
- `currentResponseHash` — optional digest of the current canonical response snapshot.
- `currentResponseAuthored` — last known `Response.authored` timestamp.
- `headEventId` — identifier of the newest retained event.

### 5.4 Example

```json
{
  "$formspecRespondentLedger": "0.1",
  "ledgerId": "ledger-018f6f2f",
  "responseId": "resp-8d0b1e85",
  "definitionUrl": "https://forms.example.gov/intake/housing-assistance",
  "definitionVersion": "2.3.0",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "createdAt": "2026-03-22T09:00:12Z",
  "lastEventAt": "2026-03-22T09:14:27Z",
  "eventCount": 4,
  "headEventId": "evt-0004",
  "currentResponseAuthored": "2026-03-22T09:14:27Z",
  "extensions": {
    "x-storage": {
      "partition": "tenant-44/us-east-1"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 6. RespondentLedgerEvent object

### 6.1 Required fields

Each event **MUST** contain at least:

- `eventId`
- `sequence`
- `eventType`
- `occurredAt`
- `recordedAt`
- `responseId`
- `definitionUrl`
- `definitionVersion`
- `actor`
- `source`

### 6.2 Conditional fields

- `changes` **MUST** be present when the event records a material state delta.
- `validationSnapshot` **SHOULD** be present for save, submit-attempt, completion, amendment, or stop transitions when validation findings are available.
- `identityAttestation` **SHOULD** be present for `identity-verified`, `attestation.captured`, delegated-signing, or other events where identity, proof-of-personhood, or assurance facts materially changed.
- `priorEventHash` and `eventHash` **SHOULD** be present when integrity chaining is enabled.
- `sessionRef` **SHOULD** be present when the implementation distinguishes respondent sessions.
- `amendmentRef` **SHOULD** be present when an event belongs to a particular reopening/amendment cycle.

### 6.3 Field semantics

- `eventId` — unique event identifier within the ledger.
- `sequence` — monotonic sequence number within the ledger.
- `eventType` — event classification defined in [Section 8](#8-event-taxonomy).
- `occurredAt` — when the underlying action happened.
- `recordedAt` — when the processor persisted the event.
- `responseId` — the response this event belongs to.
- `definitionUrl` / `definitionVersion` — the pinned definition tuple in force for the event.
- `actor` — who initiated or is attributed with the event.
- `source` — which channel or subsystem produced the event.
- `changes` — ordered set of atomic field/document/status changes, if any.
- `validationSnapshot` — point-in-time summary of validation state relevant to the event.
- `identityAttestation` — provider-neutral record of identity, proof-of-personhood, DID, or delegation evidence associated with the event.
- `privacyTier` — optional disclosure tier on the actor or identity attestation stating how linkable or revealed the subject is for this event.
- `extensions` — additive implementation-specific metadata.

### 6.4 Actor object

The `actor` object **MUST** include `kind` and **SHOULD** include one stable identifier when available.

Supported `actor.kind` values:

- `respondent`
- `delegate`
- `system`
- `support-agent`
- `unknown`

Recommended actor fields:

- `kind`
- `id`
- `display`
- `assuranceLevel`
- `did`
- `identityProviderRef`
- `subjectRef`

### 6.5 Source object

The `source` object **MUST** identify the capture channel.

Supported `source.kind` values:

- `web`
- `mobile`
- `api`
- `import`
- `system-job`
- `unknown`

Recommended source fields:

- `kind`
- `channelId`
- `deviceId`
- `ipAddressRef`
- `userAgentRef`

Implementations handling sensitive network metadata **SHOULD** store references or protected derivatives rather than raw values in the ledger itself.

### 6.6 Identity attestation object

The `identityAttestation` object is the canonical place to record identity, proof-of-personhood, delegated-access, or verifiable-credential evidence that materially affects the respondent workflow.

This object is intentionally **provider-neutral**. Implementations **SHOULD** normalize provider-specific payloads — for example an `id.me` session result, an OpenID Connect identity assertion, or a wallet-presented credential — into a common shape that can survive export, review, and future adapter changes.

Recommended identity attestation fields:

- `provider` — provider or issuer identifier such as `idme`, `login.gov`, `internal-proofing`, or a DID issuer name.
- `adapter` — implementation adapter or interface identifier used to normalize provider-specific payloads.
- `subjectRef` — stable pseudonymous subject or continuity reference that the ledger can use without embedding a real-world identifier.
- `did` — subject DID when the identity flow issues or binds one.
- `verificationMethod` — DID URL, key identifier, or other method reference used to verify the assertion.
- `credentialType` — high-level type such as `oidc-token`, `verifiable-credential`, `proof-of-personhood`, or `delegation-assertion`.
- `credentialRef` — reference to the protected credential or token envelope, not the raw secret itself.
- `personhoodCheck` — whether proof-of-personhood or liveness/uniqueness checks passed, failed, or were not performed.
- `subjectBinding` — whether the attestation is about the respondent, subject, delegate, or another party.
- `assuranceLevel` — ordered assurance tier per §6.6.1.
- `privacyTier` — disclosure tier such as `anonymous`, `pseudonymous`, `identified`, or `public`.
- `selectiveDisclosureProfile` — named policy profile controlling what parts of the attestation may be revealed in support, review, export, or dispute contexts.
- `evidenceRef` — pointer to encrypted reveal material, redacted export evidence, or provider response evidence.

### 6.6.1 Assurance levels

Implementations using `assuranceLevel` **MUST** support at minimum the following ordered four-level taxonomy:

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `L1` | Self-asserted | Subject or actor asserted the identity binding; no external corroboration. |
| `L2` | Corroborated | Binding corroborated by at least one external source (e.g., emailed magic link, phone verification). |
| `L3` | Verified | Binding verified against an authoritative source (e.g., government ID match, credential issuer). |
| `L4` | In-person or equivalent | Binding verified under conditions equivalent to in-person government-issued identity check. |

Implementations **MAY** define additional levels; additional levels **MUST** be declared with an explicit ordering position relative to the base four.

Assurance levels are declared per attestation; they are not properties of the subject. An assurance level **MAY** be upgraded by a later `attestation.captured` event referencing the same `subjectRef`, but **MUST NOT** be silently downgraded. Upgrades apply forward only; prior events **MUST NOT** be rewritten.

If a processor integrates with a third-party identity provider such as **ID.me**, it **SHOULD** do so through an adapter boundary that emits this canonical object rather than writing provider-native fields directly into the ledger event shape.

### 6.6A Identity and implementation decoupling

Processors **SHOULD** distinguish between at least three separable concerns:

1. **response state and audit continuity** — what was answered, when it changed, and what hashes/checkpoints represent that history,
2. **subject continuity** — which pseudonymous case/subject/ref the ledger is about across sessions or devices, and
3. **identity proofing** — how a respondent later proved personhood, eligibility, delegation, or legal identity.

The first concern may be stored off-chain, on-chain, or in hybrid storage. The second may be represented by a stable `subjectRef` that is intentionally not itself a legal identity. The third may be satisfied by provider adapters, DID presentations, proof-of-personhood systems, or internal proofing services that bind evidence to that `subjectRef` when policy requires it.

This means a conforming implementation can keep the form response and respondent ledger anonymous or pseudonymous by default — including when writing hashes, checkpoints, or commitments to a chain — while still using the same framework to attach higher-assurance identity proofs later.

### 6.7 Disclosure tier and assurance are independent

Implementations **MUST NOT** conflate disclosure tier (`privacyTier`) and assurance level (`assuranceLevel`). The two are independent properties of an attestation. Implementations **MUST NOT** derive one from the other, and **MUST NOT** couple their transitions.

A respondent **MAY** be highly assured and pseudonymously disclosed (a verified L3 attestation disclosed under a pseudonym). A respondent **MAY** be weakly assured and fully identified (a self-asserted L1 attestation tied to a legal name). All four combinations of privacy tier and assurance level are valid. Implementations that force these to co-vary violate this requirement.

Consequences:

- Profiles and export policies **MAY** constrain disclosure tier or assurance level independently. A profile constraining both **MUST** constrain them as independent predicates, not a joint predicate.
- `attestation.captured` events that upgrade assurance **MUST NOT** implicitly change the disclosure tier on the same `subjectRef`.
- Disclosure re-scoping (e.g., a pseudonymous record being later identified) **MUST NOT** imply an assurance upgrade.
- Reviewers and verifiers **MUST** be able to check assurance claims independently of disclosure claims.

Note: `privacyTier` uses a closed enumeration (the four values above are exhaustive); `assuranceLevel` is extensible per §6.6.1 (implementations MAY declare additional levels). This asymmetry is intentional — privacy tiers are a fixed ontology; assurance levels are an ordered scale that domains may extend.

### 6.8 Authored signatures vs. recorded attestations

A Response **MAY** carry an authored signature — a cryptographic binding by the respondent (or delegate) to the submitted Response payload at authoring time. Authored signatures are a property of the Response data contract; their shape and verification are defined where the Response itself is specified, not in this add-on.

This add-on records the fact that a signature, credential, or delegation was bound into audit history via `attestation.captured` events and `identityAttestation` objects. The two concerns are distinct and **MUST** remain distinguishable:

- An **authored signature** is evidence produced by the respondent at authoring time, binding the respondent to the Response content.
- A **recorded attestation** is an audit-history entry describing that signature (or another credential) as it was observed, validated, or admitted into workflow.

An implementation **MUST NOT** treat a recorded `attestation.captured` event as a substitute for the authored signature itself. Verifiers evaluating authenticity of Response content **MUST** verify the authored signature; the ledger event is corroborating audit context, not the signature.

---

## 7. ChangeSetEntry object

### 7.1 Purpose

A `ChangeSetEntry` is the atomic unit of respondent-visible change.

Change entries are designed to be:

- stable enough for machine analysis,
- understandable enough for respondent or support timelines,
- and compact enough to avoid storing entire response copies on every save.

### 7.2 Required fields

Each `ChangeSetEntry` **MUST** contain:

- `op`
- `path`
- `valueClass`

### 7.3 Recommended fields

Each `ChangeSetEntry` **SHOULD** include, where resolvable:

- `itemKey`
- `before`
- `after`
- `beforeHash`
- `afterHash`
- `displayBefore`
- `displayAfter`
- `reasonCode`
- `dataPointer`

### 7.4 Supported operations

Allowed `op` values:

- `set`
- `unset`
- `add`
- `remove`
- `replace`
- `reorder`
- `status-transition`

Interpretation:

- `set` — assign or overwrite a scalar/object value at an existing path.
- `unset` — clear a value while retaining the path's structural meaning.
- `add` — introduce a new array entry, attachment, or object branch.
- `remove` — remove an array entry, attachment, or object branch.
- `replace` — substitute one value/document for another where replacement semantics matter.
- `reorder` — reorder repeated elements without semantic value mutation.
- `status-transition` — record a change to lifecycle state.

### 7.5 Value classes

Allowed `valueClass` values:

- `user-input`
- `prepopulated`
- `calculated`
- `imported`
- `attachment`
- `system-derived`
- `migration-derived`

### 7.6 Path requirements

The `path` field **MUST** use the same logical response path model used by the implementation for Formspec response addressing.

A processor **SHOULD** additionally record `itemKey` when the changed node maps to a stable definition item key.

For repeated structures, implementations:

- **SHOULD** record a stable row discriminator when available,
- **MAY** include a concrete `dataPointer` using JSON Pointer notation for precise row targeting,
- **SHOULD NOT** rely on array index alone when a stable repeated-row identifier exists elsewhere in the runtime.

### 7.7 Sensitive values and minimization

Implementations **MAY** omit `before` and/or `after` when policy prohibits retention of raw values.

If raw values are omitted for policy reasons, implementations **SHOULD** record one or more of:

- `beforeHash`
- `afterHash`
- `displayBefore`
- `displayAfter`
- `semanticDelta`
- `redactionPolicy`

This enables proof that a material change happened without retaining the full sensitive content indefinitely.

### 7.8 Example

```json
{
  "op": "replace",
  "path": "household.members[1].monthlyIncome",
  "itemKey": "member_monthly_income",
  "valueClass": "user-input",
  "before": 2400,
  "after": 2800,
  "reasonCode": "user-edit"
}
```

---

## 8. Event taxonomy

### 8.1 Required event types

A conforming implementation **MUST** support the following event types when the corresponding lifecycle moments occur:

- `session.started`
- `draft.saved`
- `draft.resumed`
- `response.completed`
- `response.amendment-opened`
- `response.amended`
- `response.stopped`
- `attachment.added`
- `attachment.replaced`
- `attachment.removed`
- `prepopulation.applied`
- `system.merge-resolved`
- `validation.snapshot-recorded`

### 8.2 Optional event types

An implementation **MAY** support additional material event types, including:

- `calculation.material-change`
- `nonrelevant.pruned`
- `autosave.coalesced`
- `device-linked`
- `identity-verified`
- `attestation.captured`
- `response.submit-attempted`
- `response.migrated`

### 8.3 Event type guidance

- `session.started` — first usable interaction in a respondent session.
- `draft.saved` — explicit save or a coalesced autosave materialized as a durable checkpoint.
- `draft.resumed` — resume of an existing draft after inactivity or across devices.
- `response.submit-attempted` — attempted completion, whether or not it succeeds.
- `response.completed` — successful transition to `Response.status = completed`.
- `response.amendment-opened` — previously completed response reopened for editing.
- `response.amended` — durable completion of an amendment cycle.
- `response.stopped` — response marked abandoned or intentionally stopped.
- `attachment.*` — material attachment mutations.
- `prepopulation.applied` — external or parent-response data hydrated into the response.
- `system.merge-resolved` — platform resolved concurrent changes, conflicts, or resume merges.
- `validation.snapshot-recorded` — explicit audit capture of validation state independent of save or submit.
- `identity-verified` — an identity provider, DID verifier, or proof-of-personhood flow materially updated the assurance state relied on by the workflow.
- `attestation.captured` — a credential, delegation, personhood proof, or related attestation was durably bound into audit history.
- `response.migrated` — response was transformed to a new definition version.

### 8.4 Explicit exclusions

This specification does **not** require event types for:

- individual keystrokes,
- focus/blur changes,
- page navigation,
- every calculation reevaluation,
- or rendering lifecycle events.

---

## 9. Materiality rules

### 9.1 General rule

The ledger is for **material** respondent history.

A processor **MUST NOT** emit separate durable ledger events for every ephemeral UI action.

### 9.2 Material changes

A change is generally material if one or more of the following is true:

- it changes the persisted response state,
- it changes a completion or amendment lifecycle state,
- it adds, removes, or replaces an attachment,
- it changes a respondent-visible calculated outcome that is included in the response,
- it changes validation findings available to the respondent at a save or submit boundary,
- it changes the set of retained values because of non-relevance, migration, or merge resolution,
- or it changes an attestation, proof-of-personhood, DID binding, or assurance fact relied upon for completion.

### 9.3 Autosave coalescing

Implementations **MAY** coalesce frequent autosaves into a smaller number of durable `draft.saved` or `autosave.coalesced` events.

If autosave coalescing is used, the implementation:

- **MUST** preserve the final persisted state represented by the coalesced event,
- **SHOULD** preserve a stable ordering of the material changes included in the event,
- **SHOULD** indicate the coalescing policy in event metadata or implementation documentation.

---

## 10. Interaction with Formspec response semantics

### 10.1 Response pinning

Every ledger event **MUST** record the exact `definitionUrl` and `definitionVersion` that governed the response state at the time of the event.

Processors **MUST NOT** silently reinterpret historical events against a later definition version.

### 10.2 Response status transitions

The ledger **MUST** align response lifecycle events to the core Formspec `Response.status` states:

- `in-progress`
- `completed`
- `amended`
- `stopped`

Where status is changed, the event **SHOULD** include a `ChangeSetEntry` with `op = status-transition`.

### 10.3 Validation snapshots

When validation information is available at save, submit-attempt, completion, amendment, or stop boundaries, the event **SHOULD** contain a validation snapshot summary.

A validation snapshot **SHOULD** include:

- `valid`
- `counts.error`
- `counts.warning`
- `counts.info`
- `generatedAt`
- `resultRefs` or embedded summarized findings

The ledger **MUST NOT** change the underlying meaning of Formspec validation results. It is a capture mechanism, not an alternative validator.

### 10.4 Non-relevant fields

When non-relevant behavior causes values to be removed, nulled, or retained, implementations **SHOULD** record a material event if the persisted response shape or retained values change because of that rule.

Recommended event types:

- `nonrelevant.pruned`
- `draft.saved` with explicit `ChangeSetEntry.reasonCode = nonrelevant-prune`

### 10.5 Calculated values

Calculated values **SHOULD NOT** produce ledger noise for every reevaluation.

A processor **SHOULD** record a ledger change for a calculated value only when all of the following are true:

- the calculated value is included in the persisted response,
- the new value differs materially from the prior persisted value,
- and the change matters to respondent-visible review, downstream logic, or audit meaning.

### 10.6 Prepopulation

When data is hydrated from a parent response, external source, or imported record, the implementation **SHOULD** record `prepopulation.applied` with `valueClass = prepopulated` or `imported` for each material change entry.

If prepopulated values are later edited by the respondent, subsequent changes **SHOULD** use `valueClass = user-input` and a `reasonCode` such as `user-edit-over-prepopulation`.

---

## 11. Amendments, migration, and version evolution

### 11.1 Amendment cycles

When a completed response is reopened:

1. the processor **SHOULD** record `response.amendment-opened`,
2. the active `Response.status` will generally move to `amended` or to implementation-specific workflow around amendment editing,
3. the processor **SHOULD** tag subsequent events with an `amendmentRef`,
4. and the processor **SHOULD** record `response.amended` when the amended version is durably completed.

### 11.2 Migration across definition versions

If a saved response is migrated to a newer Formspec definition version, the original event history **MUST** remain interpretable in terms of the original pinned versions.

The migrating processor:

- **MUST** preserve prior events and their original pinned version tuple,
- **SHOULD** record `response.migrated`,
- **SHOULD** include migration provenance such as `fromDefinitionVersion`, `toDefinitionVersion`, and migration map identifier,
- **SHOULD** mark migration-generated change entries with `valueClass = migration-derived` and an appropriate `reasonCode`.

### 11.3 Interaction with changelog semantics

When a migration depends on a structural changelog or field map, the processor **SHOULD** retain a reference to the changelog or migration artifact used.

This specification does not define the migration format itself; it only defines how migration outcomes are captured in respondent history.

---

## 12. Storage and retention model

### 12.1 Storage separation

Implementations **SHOULD** store the ledger separately from the canonical response snapshot even if they expose them together through one API.

Rationale:

- response retrieval remains simple,
- ledger retention and privacy controls can evolve independently,
- append-only guarantees are easier to enforce,
- and integrity sealing can occur without mutating the response body.

### 12.2 Append-only requirement

Ledger events **MUST** be append-only from a logical semantics perspective.

Implementations **MAY** compact, archive, or move physical storage, but they **MUST NOT** rewrite event meaning in a way that misrepresents history.

If an implementation must suppress sensitive historical content after the fact, it **MUST** do so in a way that preserves clear evidence of redaction or policy-based minimization.

### 12.3 Retention and redaction

Implementations **SHOULD** define retention classes for ledger content such as:

- full raw values,
- hashed prior values,
- human-readable summaries,
- integrity-only stubs,
- and legally preserved immutable copies.

When values are redacted or compacted, the implementation **SHOULD** preserve:

- the fact that a change occurred,
- the path and item identity,
- the event timestamp,
- the actor and source category,
- and the policy basis for redaction where disclosable.

---

## 13. Integrity checkpoints

### 13.1 Purpose

A `LedgerCheckpoint` provides optional tamper-evident sealing for a contiguous range of ledger events.

### 13.2 Minimum fields

A checkpoint **SHOULD** contain:

- `checkpointId`
- `ledgerId`
- `fromSequence`
- `toSequence`
- `batchHash`
- `signedAt`

### 13.3 Recommended fields

A checkpoint **MAY** also include:

- `previousCheckpointHash`
- `signature`
- `keyId`
- `anchorRef`
- `algorithm`

### 13.4 Integrity behavior

If integrity chaining is enabled:

- each event **SHOULD** carry `priorEventHash` and `eventHash`,
- each checkpoint **SHOULD** seal an ordered contiguous event range,
- checkpoint anchoring **MAY** reference an external organizational audit ledger, transparency log, or notarization service.

This specification does not mandate any specific signature suite or external anchor.

---

## 14. Recommended JSON shape

The following non-exhaustive example shows one possible document layout:

```json
{
  "$formspecRespondentLedger": "0.1",
  "ledgerId": "ledger-018f6f2f",
  "responseId": "resp-8d0b1e85",
  "definitionUrl": "https://forms.example.gov/intake/housing-assistance",
  "definitionVersion": "2.3.0",

## 15. Implementation guidance

### 15.1 Timeline UX

Implementations exposing the ledger to respondents or support staff **SHOULD** render a timeline that:

- groups atomic field changes into save/submit/amendment moments,
- labels prepopulation distinctly from user edits,
- distinguishes attachment mutations from ordinary field edits,
- and shows validation state at save or submit boundaries.

### 15.2 Diff generation

To generate changesets efficiently, implementations **SHOULD** compare the last durable response snapshot to the new durable response snapshot and emit only material deltas.

### 15.3 Support and dispute workflows

Implementations **SHOULD** be able to answer at least these audit questions from the ledger:

- when the draft was first created,
- when it was resumed,
- which fields materially changed and in what direction,
- whether the submission was amended after completion,
- what validation state existed at save or submit,
- and whether attachment inventory changed.

### 15.4 Interoperability recommendation

Processors exchanging ledgers across systems **SHOULD** keep raw implementation-specific metadata in namespaced `extensions` fields and preserve unknown extension content on round-trip.

---

## 15A. Recommended deployment profiles

This specification intentionally allows different configurations. Implementations **SHOULD** choose an explicit deployment profile rather than partially enabling features ad hoc.

### 15A.1 Profile A — local/server ledger only

Use this when the goal is respondent history, supportability, and ordinary draft/resume/submit flows.

Recommended characteristics:

- response and ledger stored in ordinary application custody,
- no external anchoring requirement,
- no identity proofing requirement beyond local auth controls,
- value minimization enabled for sensitive prior values.

### 15A.2 Profile B — pseudonymous integrity-anchored ledger

Use this when continuity and tamper-evidence matter, but legal identity disclosure should remain optional.

Recommended characteristics:

- stable `subjectRef` used for continuity,
- signed checkpoints and platform-ledger anchoring enabled,
- response payload may remain off-chain while commitments are anchored,
- identity proofing remains optional and separately attached.

### 15A.3 Profile C — identity-bound high-assurance ledger

Use this when eligibility, regulated workflows, delegated signing, or legal attestations require stronger personhood or identity proofing.

Recommended characteristics:

- `identity-verified` / `attestation.captured` events enabled where policy requires them,
- `privacyTier`, `assuranceLevel`, and `selectiveDisclosureProfile` explicitly governed,
- identity evidence externalized behind protected references rather than embedded raw payloads,
- stronger checkpoint, export, and proof controls enabled according to deployment policy.

Processors **SHOULD NOT** force Profile C requirements into Profile A or B deployments, because doing so would over-collect identity data and make low-friction respondent history harder to adopt.

## 16. Conformance summary

A processor claiming conformance to the Respondent Ledger add-on:

1. **MUST** preserve Formspec `Response` as the canonical current-state document.
2. **MUST** keep ledger history additive and append-only in meaning.
3. **MUST** record exact `definitionUrl` and `definitionVersion` on every event.
4. **MUST** support the required event types defined in this specification when those lifecycle moments occur.
5. **MUST** represent material changes using `ChangeSetEntry` objects with `op`, `path`, and `valueClass`.
6. **MUST NOT** require keystroke-level telemetry.
7. **MUST NOT** alter Formspec core semantics through ledger data.
8. **SHOULD** preserve validation snapshots at save, submit, amendment, and stop boundaries.
9. **SHOULD** preserve provider-neutral identity / proof-of-personhood attestation references when those facts are used for completion, delegation, or eligibility-sensitive processing.
10. **SHOULD** support privacy-bounded retention using hashes, summaries, or redaction metadata where necessary.
11. **SHOULD** support optional integrity chaining and checkpointing for higher-assurance environments.

---

## 17. Open follow-on work

This draft intentionally leaves several adjacent deliverables for subsequent work:

- example mappings from existing product audit tables into the canonical ledger model,
- conformance fixtures that exercise the companion schemas,
- canonicalization guidance for hash/signature generation,
- and concrete disclosure-profile registries for export and review workflows.

Companion JSON Schemas for the top-level ledger document and standalone event object are now provided at `schemas/respondent-ledger.schema.json` and `schemas/respondent-ledger-event.schema.json`. Those schemas are intended to encode the canonical wire shape defined here; they do not narrow the broader normative model beyond the constraints stated in this document.

### 17.1 Changelog

- **0.2.0-draft (2026-04-15)** — Added normative L1–L4 assurance taxonomy (§6.6.1); promoted §6.7 to a normative independence invariant between disclosure tier and assurance level; added §6.8 distinguishing authored signatures from recorded attestations; added §2.4 legal-sufficiency disclosure. The wire-format literal `$formspecRespondentLedger` is unchanged at `"0.1"`; a wire-format version bump is a separate compatibility decision.
- **0.1.0-draft (2026-03-22)** — Initial draft.
