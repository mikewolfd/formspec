## Bottom Line Up Front

<!-- bluf:start file=component-spec.bluf.md -->
- This document defines Tier 3 Component Documents for explicit, tree-based Formspec rendering.
- A valid component document requires `$formspecComponent`, `version`, `targetDefinition`, and `tree`.
- Component trees control layout and widget selection but cannot override core behavioral semantics from the Definition.
- This BLUF is governed by `schemas/component.schema.json`; generated schema references are the canonical structural contract.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The Formspec Core Specification defines **what** data to collect (Items, core
§4.2) and **how** it behaves (Binds, Shapes). The Formspec Theme Specification
(theme-spec.md) defines **Tier 2** presentation: a selector cascade, design
tokens, widget configuration, and page layout that control how a Definition
is rendered.

This specification defines **Tier 3** of the Formspec presentation model: a
**Component Document** that describes a complete, parallel presentation tree
of UI components. Where Tier 2 maps items to widgets one-to-one via selectors,
Tier 3 builds an explicit tree of layout containers, input controls, and
display elements, with each input component **slot-bound** to a Definition
item by key.

A Component Document:

- References a Definition by URL (same binding mechanism as Tier 2 themes).
- Declares a single root component whose subtree defines the full visual
  layout of the form.
- Binds input components to Definition items, inheriting labels, validation
  rules, required state, and relevance from the Definition.
- Uses FEL expressions for conditional rendering (`when` property).
- Supports responsive breakpoint overrides and design tokens.
- Defines a fixed catalog of 35 built-in components (18 Core + 17
  Progressive) plus a custom component registry for reuse.

Multiple Component Documents MAY target the same Definition. This enables
platform-specific presentations (web wizard, mobile single-page, print layout)
without modifying the Definition or its behavioral rules.

### 1.2 Relationship to Formspec Core, Theme Spec, and FEL

The Formspec architecture defines a three-tier presentation model:

| Tier | Concern | Defined In |
|------|---------|------------|
| 1. Structure hints | Advisory widget hints on Items | Core §4.2.5 (`presentation`) |
| 2. Theme | Selector cascade, tokens, layout grid | Theme Spec (theme-spec.md) |
| 3. Component | Explicit component tree with slot binding | **This specification** |

Tier 3 is the most expressive layer. When a Component Document is applied,
it takes precedence over both Tier 2 themes and Tier 1 inline hints for
layout and widget selection. However, the Definition's **behavioral** rules
(required, relevant, readonly, constraint, calculate) always govern data
semantics — Tier 3 cannot override them.

Tier 3 MAY coexist with a Tier 2 theme. When both are present:

- The Component Document controls layout and component selection.
- Theme tokens are available as `$token.` references within the Component
  Document (§10.3).
- Items not explicitly bound in the component tree fall back to Tier 2/Tier 1
  rendering (§11.1).

FEL expressions (fel-grammar.md) are used in the `when` property for
conditional rendering (§8). FEL is NOT used for computed props, data
transformation, or any purpose other than boolean visibility conditions
and display text interpolation.

### 1.3 Conformance Levels (Core / Complete)

This specification defines two conformance levels:

| Level | Components | Requirement |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Core Conformant** | 18 Core components (§5) | MUST support all 18 Core components. MUST apply fallback rules (§6.18) when encountering Progressive components. |
| **Complete Conformant** | All 35 components (§5 + §6) | MUST support all 18 Core components and all 17 Progressive components. |

A processor that claims Core conformance MUST, upon encountering a
Progressive component, substitute the specified Core fallback (§6.18)
and SHOULD emit an informative warning.

A processor that claims Complete conformance MUST render all 35 built-in
components natively.

Both levels MUST support the custom component mechanism (§7).

### 1.4 Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Definition** | A Formspec Definition document (core spec §4). |
| **Component Document** | A Formspec Component document conforming to this specification. |
| **Component** | A node in the component tree. Each component has a type, optional binding, and optional children. |
| **Tier 1 hints** | The `formPresentation` and `presentation` properties defined in core spec §4.1.1 and §4.2.5. |
| **Tier 2 theme** | A Formspec Theme Document conforming to theme-spec.md. |
| **Tier 3 component** | A Component Document conforming to this specification. |
| **Renderer** | Software that presents a Definition to end users using a Component Document. |
| **Token** | A named design value (color, spacing, typography) defined in the `tokens` map. |
| **Slot binding** | The association between a component and a Definition item via the `bind` property. |
| **Core component** | One of the 17 components that all conforming processors MUST support. |
| **Progressive component** | One of the 16 additional components that Complete processors MUST support, with defined fallbacks for Core processors. |
| **Custom component** | A reusable component template defined in the `components` registry. |

---

## 2. Document Structure

A Formspec Component Document is a JSON object. Conforming implementations
MUST recognize the following top-level properties and MUST reject any
Component Document that omits a REQUIRED property.

```json
{
  "$formspecComponent": "1.0",
  "url": "https://agency.gov/forms/budget/components/wizard",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "targetDefinition": {
    "url": "https://agency.gov/forms/budget",
    "compatibleVersions": ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"
  },
  "breakpoints": {
    "sm": 576,
    "md": 768,
    "lg": 1024
  },
  "tokens": {},
  "components": {},
  "tree": {}
}
```

### 2.1 Top-Level Properties

<!-- schema-ref:start id=component-top-level schema=schemas/component.schema.json pointers=# -->
<!-- generated:schema-ref id=component-top-level -->
| Pointer | Field | Type | Required | Notes | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `#/properties/$formspecComponent` | `$formspecComponent` | <code>string</code> | yes | const: <code>"1.0"</code>; critical | Component specification version. MUST be '1.0'. |
| `#/properties/breakpoints` | `breakpoints` | <code>&#36;ref</code> | no | <code>&#36;ref</code>: <code>#/&#36;defs/Breakpoints</code> | Named viewport breakpoints for responsive prop overrides. Keys are breakpoint names; values are minimum viewport widths in pixels. Mobile-first cascade: base props apply to all widths, then overrides merge in ascending order. |
| `#/properties/components` | `components` | <code>object</code> | no | — | Registry of custom component templates. Keys are PascalCase names (MUST NOT collide with built-in names). Each template has params and a tree that is instantiated with {param} interpolation. |
| `#/properties/description` | `description` | <code>string</code> | no | — | Human-readable description. |
| `#/properties/name` | `name` | <code>string</code> | no | — | Machine-friendly short identifier. |
| `#/properties/targetDefinition` | `targetDefinition` | <code>&#36;ref</code> | yes | <code>&#36;ref</code>: <code>#/&#36;defs/TargetDefinition</code>; critical | Binding to the target Formspec Definition and optional compatibility range. |
| `#/properties/title` | `title` | <code>string</code> | no | — | Human-readable name. |
| `#/properties/tokens` | `tokens` | <code>&#36;ref</code> | no | <code>&#36;ref</code>: <code>#/&#36;defs/Tokens</code> | Flat key-value map of design tokens. Referenced in style objects and token-able props via $token.key syntax. Tier 3 tokens override Tier 2 theme tokens of the same key. |
| `#/properties/tree` | `tree` | <code>&#36;ref</code> | yes | <code>&#36;ref</code>: <code>#/&#36;defs/AnyComponent</code>; critical | Root component node of the presentation tree. MUST be a single component object (wrap multiple children in Stack or Page). |
| `#/properties/url` | `url` | <code>string</code> | no | — | Canonical URI identifier for this Component Document. |
| `#/properties/version` | `version` | <code>string</code> | yes | critical | Version of this Component Document. |
<!-- schema-ref:end -->

The generated table above is the canonical structural contract for Component
Document top-level properties.

Processors MUST ignore unrecognized top-level properties whose keys begin
with `x-`. Processors MUST reject unrecognized top-level properties that
do NOT begin with `x-`.

### 2.2 Target Definition Binding

The `targetDefinition` object binds this Component Document to a specific
Definition.

| Property | Type | Cardinality | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | string (URI) | **1..1** (REQUIRED) | Canonical URL of the target Definition (`url` property from the Definition). |
| `compatibleVersions` | string | **0..1** (OPTIONAL) | Semver range expression (e.g., `">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"`) describing which Definition versions this Component Document supports. When absent, the document is assumed compatible with any version. |

When `compatibleVersions` is present, a processor SHOULD verify that the
Definition's `version` satisfies the range before applying the component
tree. A processor MUST NOT fail if the range is unsatisfied; it SHOULD
warn and MAY fall back to Tier 2/Tier 1 rendering.

The binding mechanism is identical to the Theme Specification's
`targetDefinition` (theme-spec §2.2). A Component Document and a Theme
Document MAY target the same Definition simultaneously.

### 2.3 MIME Type (.formspec-component.json)

Formspec Component Documents SHOULD use the file extension
`.formspec-component.json`.

When served over HTTP, the content type SHOULD be
`application/json`. Processors MAY recognize the custom media type
`application/formspec-component+json` when registered.

The file extension convention enables tooling to distinguish Component
Documents from Definition documents (`.formspec.json`) and Theme
Documents (`.formspec-theme.json`) by filename alone.

### 2.4 Minimal Conforming Document

The following is the smallest valid Component Document:

```json
{
  "$formspecComponent": "1.0",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "targetDefinition": {
    "url": "https://example.com/form"
  },
  "tree": {
    "component": "Stack",
    "children": [
      { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "name" }
    ]
  }
}
```

This document:

- Declares `$formspecComponent` version `"1.0"` (REQUIRED).
- Provides a `version` for the document itself (REQUIRED).
- Binds to a target Definition via `targetDefinition` (REQUIRED).
- Defines a root `tree` with a single `Stack` containing one `TextInput`
  bound to the item key `"name"` (REQUIRED).

All other top-level properties (`url`, `name`, `title`, `description`,
`breakpoints`, `tokens`, `components`) are OPTIONAL and default to
empty/absent.

---

## 3. Component Model

A component tree is a hierarchical structure of **component objects**.
Each component object describes a single UI element — a layout container,
an input control, a display element, or a structural grouping.

### 3.1 Component Object Base Properties

Every component object is a JSON object. The following base properties
are recognized on all component objects:

| Property | Type | Cardinality | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `component` | string | **1..1** (REQUIRED) | The component type name. MUST be a built-in component name (§5, §6) or a key in the `components` registry (§7). |
| `id` | string | **0..1** (OPTIONAL) | Unique identifier within the component tree document. See below. |
| `bind` | string | **0..1** (varies) | Item key from the Definition. See §4 for rules per component category. |
| `when` | string (FEL) | **0..1** (OPTIONAL) | FEL boolean expression for conditional rendering. See §8. |
| `responsive` | object | **0..1** (OPTIONAL) | Breakpoint-keyed prop overrides. See §9. |
| `style` | object | **0..1** (OPTIONAL) | Flat style map. Values MAY contain `$token.path` references. See §10.2. |
| `cssClass` | string \| array of strings | **0..1** (OPTIONAL) | CSS class name(s) that web renderers SHOULD apply to the component's root element. Additive to renderer-generated classes. Non-web renderers MAY ignore. Values MAY contain `$token.` references. |
| `accessibility` | AccessibilityBlock | **0..1** (OPTIONAL) | Accessibility overrides applied to the component's root element. See §3.5. |
| `children` | array | **0..1** (varies) | Array of child component objects. Only components that accept children (§3.4) MAY include this property. |

##### `id` (Optional)

Components MAY include an `id` property — a unique string identifier
within the component tree document. The `id` MUST match the pattern
`^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_\-]*$` (letters, digits, underscores, hyphens;
must start with a letter).

When present, `id` MUST be unique across the entire component tree
document. The `id` enables:

- **Locale string addressing:** `$component.<id>.<prop>` keys in
  Locale Documents (locale spec §3.1.8).
- **Test selectors:** Stable identifiers for automated testing.
- **Accessibility anchoring:** Stable references for assistive
  technology integration.

Processors MUST validate `id` uniqueness when both `id` values and
the component tree are available:

- At validation/linting time, an `id` collision MUST produce an
  **error**.
- At runtime, an `id` collision SHOULD produce a **warning** and
  the processor MUST bind only the **first occurrence** in document
  order (matching the editable binding uniqueness pattern in §4.3).

##### Repeat template nodes

When a component node with `id` appears inside a repeat template
(as a child of a DataTable bound to a repeatable group per §6.14, or
an Accordion per §6.3), the `id` identifies the **template node**,
not individual rendered instances. All rendered instances of the
template share the same `id`. This is consistent with the
template-instantiation rendering model defined in §4.4 — the
component tree document contains one subtree that the renderer
instantiates N times.

For locale addressing, this means a single locale key
`$component.<id>.<prop>` applies to all repeat instances. If
per-instance text is needed, the locale string value may use FEL
interpolation with `@index` and `@count` (evaluated in each repeat
instance's binding scope).

In addition to these base properties, each component type defines its own
**component-specific props** (documented in §5 and §6). Component-specific
props are siblings of the base properties in the same JSON object.

Example of a fully-specified component object:

```json
{
  "component": "TextInput",
  "bind": "projectName",
  "when": "$hasProject = true",
  "placeholder": "Enter project name",
  "style": {
    "borderColor": "$token.color.primary"
  },
  "responsive": {
    "sm": { "placeholder": "Project" }
  }
}
```

Processors MUST ignore unrecognized properties on component objects.
This enables forward-compatible extension.

### 3.2 Component Tree Semantics (single root)

The `tree` property MUST contain exactly **one** component object. This
object is the **root** of the component tree.

To present multiple components at the top level, authors MUST wrap them
in a layout component (typically `Stack` or `Page`):

```json
// ✗ INVALID — tree cannot be an array
"tree": [
  { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "name" },
  { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "email" }
]

// ✓ VALID — single root wrapping multiple children
"tree": {
  "component": "Stack",
  "children": [
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "name" },
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "email" }
  ]
}
```

The root component MAY be any component that accepts children (Layout
or Container). A root that is a leaf component (Input or Display) is
valid but yields a form with a single element.

### 3.3 Children Ordering

The `children` array defines an **ordered** list. Renderers MUST
preserve the array order when rendering:

- The first child in the array MUST be rendered first (topmost in a
  vertical stack, leftmost in a horizontal layout, first column in a
  grid).
- Subsequent children MUST follow in array order.

Renderers MUST NOT reorder children unless explicitly instructed by a
responsive override (§9) that changes layout properties (e.g., switching
a Stack's direction), but even then the logical array order is preserved
within the new layout direction.

### 3.4 Nesting Constraints

Components are classified into four categories. Nesting rules depend on
the category:

| Category | Accepts `children` | Examples |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Layout** | Yes | Page, Stack, Grid, Columns, Tabs, Accordion |
| **Container** | Yes | Card, Collapsible, ConditionalGroup, Panel, Modal, Popover |
| **Input** | No | TextInput, NumberInput, Select, Toggle, … |
| **Display** | No | Heading, Text, Divider, Alert, Badge, … |

Rules:

1. **Layout and Container** components MAY contain any component type
   as children (Layout, Container, Input, or Display), unless further
   restricted by the specific component (e.g., Tabs children SHOULD
   be Page components for correct tab rendering).

2. **Input and Display** components MUST NOT have a `children` property.
   If present, processors MUST reject the document or ignore the
   `children` property and emit a warning.

3. **Spacer** MUST NOT have children (it is a Layout leaf).

4. Nesting depth SHOULD NOT exceed 20 levels. Processors MAY reject
   documents exceeding this limit.

---

### 3.5 AccessibilityBlock

The optional `accessibility` property on any component object is an
**AccessibilityBlock** — a flat object that lets authors override or
supplement the ARIA attributes applied to the component's root element.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `role` | string | ARIA role override (e.g., `"region"`, `"group"`, `"status"`). Replaces any renderer-default role. |
| `description` | string | Accessible description text. Renderers SHOULD wire this to `aria-describedby` (not `aria-description`, which is not a valid ARIA attribute). |
| `liveRegion` | `"off"` \| `"polite"` \| `"assertive"` | Sets `aria-live` on the root element. Renderers MUST NOT apply `role="status"` or any live-region semantics unless this property is explicitly set. |

Renderers MUST apply all present `AccessibilityBlock` properties to the
component's root DOM element. If a property is absent, the renderer's
default behaviour is preserved.

### 3.6 Localizable String Properties

The following table lists component properties that contain
human-readable text addressable by Locale Documents via
`$component.<id>.<prop>` keys. Only components with an `id`
property are addressable.

| Component | Localizable Props |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Page | `title`, `description` |
| Heading | `text` |
| Text | `text` |
| Alert | `text` |
| Divider | `label` |
| Card | `title`, `subtitle` |
| Collapsible | `title` |
| ConditionalGroup | `fallback` |
| Tabs | `tabLabels[N]` |
| Accordion | `labels[N]` |
| SubmitButton | `label`, `pendingLabel` |
| DataTable | `columns[N].header` |
| Panel | `title` |
| Modal | `title`, `triggerLabel` |
| Popover | `triggerLabel` |
| Badge | `text` |
| ProgressBar | `label` |
| Summary | `items[N].label` |
| Select | `placeholder` |
| TextInput | `placeholder`, `prefix`, `suffix` |

Array-valued properties use bracket indexing with numeric indices
(e.g., `$component.mainTabs.tabLabels[0]`).

---

## 4. Slot Binding

Slot binding is the mechanism by which components in the presentation tree
are associated with items in the Formspec Definition. The `bind` property
on a component object establishes this association.

### 4.1 The bind Property

The `bind` property is a **string** that identifies an item in the
target Definition. It accepts two forms:

1. **Flat key** — a single `key` matching a top-level item
   (e.g., `"projectName"`).
2. **Dotted qualified path** — a dot-delimited path from a group key
   to a nested child key (e.g., `"applicantInfo.orgName"`).

The `bind` value is NOT a JSON Pointer or FEL expression.

```json
// Top-level item — flat key:
{ "component": "TextInput", "bind": "projectName" }

// Nested item — dotted qualified path:
{ "component": "TextInput", "bind": "applicantInfo.orgName" }
```

The `bind` value MUST be a non-empty string. The value MUST correspond
to an item `key` (or a dotted path resolving to a nested item) in the
target Definition. If the key does not resolve to any item in the
Definition, the processor MUST emit a warning and SHOULD hide
the component.

### 4.2 Bind Resolution Rules

The meaning and requirement of `bind` varies by component category:

| Category | `bind` | Behavior |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Input** | REQUIRED | The component reads and writes the bound item's value. The renderer MUST propagate the item's `required`, `readOnly`, and `relevant` state to the input control. Validation errors for the bound key MUST be displayed adjacent to this component. |
| **Display** | OPTIONAL | When present, the component displays the bound item's current value as read-only content. When absent, the component renders its static `text` prop. |
| **Layout** | FORBIDDEN | Layout components MUST NOT have a `bind` property. If present, processors MUST ignore it and emit a warning. |
| **Container** | FORBIDDEN | Container components MUST NOT have a `bind` property, with the exceptions of **DataTable** (§6.14) and **Accordion** (§6.3), which MAY bind to a repeatable group. |

When an Input component is bound to a field item:

1. **Label:** The renderer MUST display the item's `label`.
2. **Hint:** The renderer SHOULD display the item's `hint` when available.
3. **Required indicator:** The renderer MUST indicate required state when
   the item's Bind `required` expression evaluates to `true`.
4. **Read-only state:** The renderer MUST disable editing when the item's
   Bind `readOnly` expression evaluates to `true` or when the item has
   a `calculate` Bind.
5. **Relevant state:** When the item's Bind `relevant` expression
   evaluates to `false`, the renderer MUST hide the component. This
   operates independently of the component's `when` property (§8.2).
6. **Validation errors:** The renderer MUST display validation results
   (core §5.6) adjacent to the input component that binds the errored key.

### 4.3 Editable Binding Uniqueness

At most **one** editable Input component MAY bind to a given item key.
If two or more editable Input components bind to the same key, the
processor MUST reject the document or emit a warning and bind only the
first occurrence.

Multiple **read-only Display** components MAY bind to the same key.
This is useful for showing a field's value in a summary section while
also rendering an input elsewhere.

Example:

```json
// ✓ VALID — one input + one display for same key
{ "component": "NumberInput", "bind": "totalBudget" }
// ... elsewhere in the tree:
{ "component": "Text", "bind": "totalBudget" }

// ✗ INVALID — two inputs for same key
{ "component": "NumberInput", "bind": "totalBudget" }
{ "component": "Slider", "bind": "totalBudget" }
```

> **Informative note:** This constraint prevents conflicting write
> paths. If a future extension requires multiple input modalities for
> the same field, it should define explicit synchronization semantics.

### 4.4 Repeatable Group Binding

When a component binds to a **repeatable group** item (an item with
`type: "group"` and `minRepeat`/`maxRepeat` in the Definition), the
component acts as a **repeat template**.

The renderer MUST:

1. Render one instance of the component (and its children) for each
   repeat instance in the data.
2. Within each repeat instance, resolve child `bind` values relative
   to the repeat context. Child keys are still flat item keys, but they
   resolve within the current repeat instance.
3. Provide affordances for adding and removing repeat instances, subject
   to `minRepeat` and `maxRepeat` constraints from the Definition.

Repeatable group binding is available on **DataTable** (§6.14), where each
repeat instance becomes a table row, and on **Accordion** (§6.3), where
each repeat instance becomes a collapsible section.

Other layout and container components MUST NOT bind to repeatable groups.
Processors MUST reject such bindings.

### 4.5 Unbound Required Items

A Component Document is NOT required to bind every item in the Definition.
However, the renderer MUST ensure that all **required** items (items
whose Bind `required` evaluates to `true`) are rendered and editable.

For required items that are NOT bound to any Input component in the tree:

1. The renderer MUST render a fallback input for each unbound required
   item.
2. Fallback rendering MUST use Tier 2 theme rules if a Theme Document
   is present, or Tier 1 `presentation` hints otherwise, or renderer
   defaults as a last resort.
3. Fallback inputs MUST be appended **after** the component tree's
   rendered output, in Definition document order.
4. The renderer SHOULD visually distinguish fallback-rendered items
   (e.g., with a "Additional required fields" heading).

For non-required items that are not bound, the renderer MAY omit them
entirely. If the Definition's `relevant` expression for an unbound item
evaluates to `true` and the item is visible, the renderer SHOULD render
it using fallback rules.

### 4.6 Bind/dataType Compatibility Matrix

Each Input component declares which Definition `dataType` values it is
compatible with. Binding a component to an item with an incompatible
`dataType` is a validation error.

| `dataType` | Compatible Input Components |
|---|---|
| `string` | TextInput |
| `number` | NumberInput, Slider, Rating |
| `integer` | NumberInput, Slider, Rating |
| `boolean` | Toggle |
| `date` | DatePicker |
| `dateTime` | DatePicker |
| `time` | DatePicker |
| `choice` | Select, RadioGroup |
| `multiChoice` | CheckboxGroup, Select |
| `attachment` | FileUpload, Signature |

Notes:

- **NumberInput** is compatible with `number`, `integer`, and
  (via formatting) items that use `prefix`/`suffix` for currency display.
- **Slider** and **Rating** are Progressive components; their fallback
  is NumberInput.
- **RadioGroup** is a Progressive component; its fallback is Select.
- **Select** on a `multiChoice` item MUST set `multiple` to `true` so the
  control stores an array of values (same shape as CheckboxGroup). Using
  Select without `multiple` on `multiChoice` is incompatible with the
  stored value type.
- **Signature** is a Progressive component; its fallback is FileUpload.
- Display components (Text, Heading, etc.) are compatible with any
  `dataType` when used in read-only mode via `bind`.

Processors MUST validate bind/dataType compatibility and MUST reject
or warn on incompatible bindings.

## 5. Built-In Components — Core (18)

This section defines the 18 Core components that all conforming
processors MUST support. Components are grouped by category: Layout,
Input, Display, and Container.

For each component, the specification provides:

- **Category** and **Level** classification.
- Whether the component **accepts children**.
- The **bind** requirement (Required, Optional, or Forbidden).
- **Compatible dataTypes** (Input components only).
- A description, props table, rendering requirements, and example.

---

### 5.1 Page

**Category:** Layout
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** Yes
**Bind:** Forbidden

#### Description

A top-level page container representing a logical section of a form.
When `formPresentation.pageMode` is `"wizard"` or `"tabs"`, Pages define
the navigation steps or tab panels. Pages MAY also be used standalone
within a Stack for single-page sectioned forms.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `title` | string | — | No | Page heading displayed at the top of the section. |
| `description` | string | — | No | Subtitle or description text rendered below the title. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a block-level section element (e.g., `<section>` or
  equivalent).
- When `title` is present, MUST render it as a heading element.
- When `formPresentation.pageMode` is `"wizard"`, the Page MUST be
  shown/hidden according to the current step navigation state.
- MUST render children in array order within the section.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Page",
  "title": "Project Information",
  "description": "Enter basic details about your project.",
  "children": [
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "projectName" },
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "projectCode" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 5.2 Stack

**Category:** Layout
**Level:** Core

|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `direction` | string | `"vertical"` | No | Stack direction. MUST be one of `"vertical"` or `"horizontal"`. |
| `gap` | string \| number | `0` | Yes | Spacing between children. String values (e.g., `"16px"`, `"$token.spacing.md"`) or numeric pixel values. |
| `align` | string | `"stretch"` | No | Cross-axis alignment. MUST be one of `"start"`, `"center"`, `"end"`, `"stretch"`. |
| `wrap` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether children wrap to the next line when `direction` is `"horizontal"`. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a flex container with the specified direction.
- MUST apply `gap` between adjacent visible children.
- MUST apply `align` to the cross-axis.
- When `wrap` is `true` and direction is horizontal, children MUST
  wrap to new rows when they exceed container width.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Stack",
  "direction": "vertical",
  "gap": "$token.spacing.md",
  "children": [
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "firstName" },
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "lastName" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 5.3 Grid

**Category:** Layout
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** Yes
**Bind:** Forbidden

#### Description

A multi-column grid layout that distributes children across columns.
Children are placed in source order, wrapping to new rows as needed.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `columns` | integer \| string | `2` | Yes | Number of columns (integer) or a CSS grid-template-columns value (string, e.g., `"1fr 2fr 1fr"`). |
| `gap` | string \| number | `0` | Yes | Spacing between grid cells. |
| `rowGap` | string \| number | (inherits `gap`) | Yes | Vertical spacing between rows, if different from `gap`. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a grid container with the specified column count
  or template.
- MUST distribute children into cells in source order, left-to-right
  then top-to-bottom (for LTR locales).
- MUST apply gap spacing between cells.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Grid",
  "columns": 3,
  "gap": "$token.spacing.md",
  "children": [
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "firstName" },
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "middleName" },
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "lastName" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 5.4 \[Reserved\]

The Wizard component type was removed in favor of
`formPresentation.pageMode: "wizard"` with a `Stack > Page*` tree
structure. See Core §4.1.2 for normative page mode processing
requirements. Wizard-style navigation is now a presentation mode
applied to a Stack of Pages, not a distinct component type.

---

### 5.5 Spacer

**Category:** Layout
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Forbidden

#### Description

An empty spacing element that inserts visual space between siblings.
Spacer is a leaf component with no children and no binding.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|

**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `string`, `number` (as text), `date` (as text), `time` (as text), `dateTime` (as text)

#### Description

A single-line or multi-line text input field. This is the default
input component for string-type fields. When `maxLines` is greater
than 1, the input renders as a multi-line textarea.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `placeholder` | string | — | No | Placeholder text displayed when the field is empty. |
| `maxLines` | integer | `1` | No | Maximum visible lines. `1` = single-line input, `>1` = multi-line textarea. MUST be ≥ 1. |
| `inputMode` | string | `"text"` | No | Input mode hint. One of `"text"`, `"email"`, `"tel"`, `"url"`, `"search"`. |
| `prefix` | string | — | No | Static text rendered before the input (e.g., `"https://"`). |

  "component": "TextInput",
  "bind": "email",
  "placeholder": "you@example.com",
  "inputMode": "email"
}
```

---

### 5.7 NumberInput

**Category:** Input
**Level:** Core

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a numeric input element (`<input type="number">` or
  equivalent).
- MUST reject non-numeric input at the UI level.
- MUST propagate `required`, `readOnly`, and `relevant` from the
  bound item.
- MUST display validation errors from the bound item.
- When `min` or `max` is specified, MUST constrain the stepper
  controls accordingly.

#### Example

```

---

### 5.8 DatePicker

**Category:** Input
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `date`, `dateTime`, `time`

#### Description

A date, datetime, or time picker control. The picker mode is
automatically determined by the bound item's `dataType`.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `format` | string | — | No | Display format hint (e.g., `"YYYY-MM-DD"`, `"MM/DD/YYYY"`). Does not affect stored value (always ISO 8601). |
| `minDate` | string | — | No | Earliest selectable date (ISO 8601). |
| `maxDate` | string | — | No | Latest selectable date (ISO 8601). |
| `showTime` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether to include time selection (relevant for `dateTime`). |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render an appropriate picker for the bound dataType:
  - `date` → date picker
  - `dateTime` → date + time picker
  - `time` → time picker
- MUST store values in ISO 8601 format regardless of display format.
- MUST propagate `required`, `readOnly`, and `relevant` state.
- MUST display validation errors.
- When `minDate` or `maxDate` is specified, MUST disable dates
  outside the range.

}
```

---

### 5.9 Select

**Category:** Input
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `choice`, `multiChoice`

#### Description

A single- or multi-select control for choice lists. Options are read from
the bound item's `options` array or `optionSet` reference in the
Definition.

By default (when `searchable` and `multiple` are both false or omitted),
processors SHOULD render a native HTML `<select>` (or platform
equivalent) for a compact dropdown.

When `searchable` is `true` and/or `multiple` is `true`, processors MUST
render an accessible **combobox** pattern: a text field (filter and/or
summary), an associated listbox, and keyboard support consistent with
WAI-ARIA combobox/listbox guidance. For `multiple`, the listbox MUST
allow toggling several options (e.g., checkboxes per row) and MUST store
an array of selected option `value`s in the response data.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `searchable` | boolean | `false` | No | Use a combobox with optional type-ahead filtering of option labels. When `false` and `multiple` is `false`, a native `<select>` is used. |
| `multiple` | boolean | `false` | No | Allow multiple selections; bind to a `multiChoice` item. Implies a combobox list; combine with `searchable` for filtering. |
| `placeholder` | string | `"Select…"` | No | Placeholder text when no option is selected (or when the closed combobox shows an empty state). |
| `clearable` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether the user can clear the selection (`null` for single; empty array for multiple). |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST read options from the bound item's `options` or `optionSet`.
- MUST display the option `label` to the user and store the option
  `value` in the data (single scalar for `choice`; array of values for
  `multiChoice` when `multiple` is `true`).
- MUST propagate `required`, `readOnly`, and `relevant` state.
- MUST display validation errors.
- When `searchable` is `false` and `multiple` is `false`, MUST render a
  single-select dropdown (native `<select>` or equivalent).
- When `searchable` is `true` or `multiple` is `true`, MUST expose a
  combobox (`role="combobox"`) and listbox (`role="listbox"`) with
  `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-activedescendant` (or
  equivalent) as appropriate; when `multiple` is `true`, the listbox
  MUST set `aria-multiselectable="true"`.
- When `searchable` is `true`, MUST filter visible options by the user's
  typed query using a case-insensitive substring match against each option's
  `label`, its stored `value`, and any strings in the definition option's
  optional `keywords` array (for abbreviations and alternate names).

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Select",
  "bind": "department",
  "searchable": true,
  "placeholder": "Choose a department"
}
```

Multi-select combobox:

```json
{
  "component": "Select",
  "bind": "tags",
  "multiple": true,
  "searchable": true,
  "placeholder": "Select tags"
}
```

### 5.10 CheckboxGroup

**Category:** Input
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `multiChoice`

#### Description

A group of checkboxes for multi-select fields. Options are read from
the bound item's `options` or `optionSet`.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `columns` | integer | `1` | No | Number of columns to arrange checkboxes in. |
| `selectAll` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether to display a "Select All" control. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render one checkbox per option.
- MUST allow multiple simultaneous selections.
- MUST store the value as an array of selected option values.
- MUST propagate `required`, `readOnly`, and `relevant` state.
- MUST display validation errors.
- When `selectAll` is `true`, MUST provide a master toggle control.

#### Example

  "columns": 2,
  "selectAll": true
}
```

---

### 5.11 Toggle

**Category:** Input
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `boolean`

#### Description

A boolean switch/toggle control. Suitable for yes/no, on/off, or
true/false fields.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `onLabel` | string | `"On"` | No | Label displayed when the toggle is in the `true` state. |
| `offLabel` | string | `"Off"` | No | Label displayed when the toggle is in the `false` state. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a switch/toggle control (not a checkbox).
- MUST store `true` or `false` in the data.
- MUST propagate `required`, `readOnly`, and `relevant` state.
- MUST display validation errors.
- MUST display the appropriate label (`onLabel`/`offLabel`) for the
  current state.

  "onLabel": "I agree",
  "offLabel": "I do not agree"
}
```

---

### 5.12 FileUpload

**Category:** Input
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `attachment`

#### Description

A file upload control for attachment-type fields. Supports single or
multiple file selection with optional type and size constraints.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `accept` | string | `"*/*"` | No | Accepted MIME types (comma-separated, e.g., `"image/*,application/pdf"`). |
| `maxSize` | integer | — | No | Maximum file size in bytes. |
| `multiple` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether multiple files may be uploaded. |
| `dragDrop` | boolean | `true` | No | Whether to display a drag-and-drop zone. |

#### Rendering Requirements

  "multiple": true
}
```

---

### 5.13 Heading

**Category:** Display
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Forbidden

#### Description

A section heading element. Used to structure the visual hierarchy of
the form. Heading is purely presentational and does not bind to data.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `level` | integer | — (REQUIRED) | No | Heading level, 1–6. MUST correspond to HTML heading semantics (`<h1>`–`<h6>`). |
| `text` | string | — (REQUIRED) | No | The heading text content. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a heading element at the specified level.
- MUST render the `text` content.
- MUST NOT accept a `bind` property. If present, processors MUST
  ignore it.

#### Example

```json
{ "component": "Heading", "level": 2, "text": "Budget Details" }
```

---

### 5.14 Text

**Category:** Display
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Optional

#### Description

A block of static or data-bound text. When `bind` is present, displays
the bound item's current value as read-only text. When `bind` is
absent, displays the static `text` prop.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `text` | string | `""` | No | Static text content. Ignored when `bind` is present. |
| `format` | string | `"plain"` | No | Text format. MUST be one of `"plain"` or `"markdown"`. When `"markdown"`, renderers SHOULD render basic Markdown formatting (bold, italic, links, lists). |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a paragraph or inline text element.
- When `bind` is present, MUST display the bound item's formatted
  value. The renderer SHOULD apply appropriate formatting based on
  the item's `dataType` (e.g., date formatting, number formatting).
- When `format` is `"markdown"`, MUST render basic Markdown. Renderers
  MUST sanitize Markdown output to prevent script injection.

#### Example

```json
// Static text
{ "component": "Text", "text": "Please review before submitting.", "format": "markdown" }

// Bound text
{ "component": "Text", "bind": "totalBudget" }
```

```

---

### 5.16 Card

**Category:** Container
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** Yes
**Bind:** Forbidden

#### Description

A bordered surface that visually groups related content. Cards provide
a visual boundary with optional title and subtitle.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `title` | string | — | No | Card header title. |
| `subtitle` | string | — | No | Card header subtitle, rendered below the title. |
| `elevation` | string | `"low"` | Yes | Shadow depth. SHOULD map to a token (e.g., `"$token.elevation.low"`). |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a visually distinct surface with a border or
  shadow.
- When `title` is present, MUST render a card header.
- MUST render children in array order within the card body.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Card",
  "title": "Contact Information",
  "children": [
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "email" },
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "phone" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 5.17 Collapsible

**Category:** Container
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** Yes
**Bind:** Forbidden

#### Description

An expandable/collapsible section. The user can toggle visibility of
the children. Useful for optional sections or advanced options.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `title` | string | — (REQUIRED) | No | The collapsible section header. MUST be visible regardless of open/closed state. |
| `defaultOpen` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether the section is initially expanded. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render a clickable header that toggles child visibility.
- MUST display the `title` in the header.
- When collapsed, children MUST be hidden but MUST remain in the
  DOM/component tree (their bound data is preserved).
- Collapsed children's `relevant` and `when` state MUST still be
  evaluated.
- MUST apply appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, etc.).

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Collapsible",
  "title": "Advanced Options",
  "defaultOpen": false,
  "children": [
    { "component": "Toggle", "bind": "enableNotifications" },
    { "component": "Select", "bind": "notificationFrequency" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 5.18 ConditionalGroup

**Category:** Container
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** Yes
**Bind:** Forbidden

#### Description

A container whose visibility is controlled by a **required** `when`
expression. Unlike the optional `when` property available on all
components (§8), ConditionalGroup makes the condition its primary
purpose — it exists solely to conditionally show/hide a group of
children.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `when` | string (FEL) | — (REQUIRED) | No | FEL boolean expression. When `false` or `null`, the group and all children are hidden. **REQUIRED** on ConditionalGroup (unlike optional `when` on other components). |
| `fallback` | string | — | No | Optional text to display when the condition is `false`. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST evaluate the `when` expression against the data tree.
- When the expression evaluates to `true`, MUST render all children.
- When the expression evaluates to `false` or `null`, MUST hide all
  children. If `fallback` text is present, MUST display it in place
  of the hidden children.
- Data-bound children within a hidden ConditionalGroup retain their
  data values (unlike Bind `relevant`, which may clear data).
- A ConditionalGroup without a `when` expression is invalid.
  Processors MUST reject such documents.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "ConditionalGroup",
  "when": "$hasEmployer = true",
  "fallback": "Employer details are not required for this application type.",
  "children": [
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "employerName" },
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "employerAddress" }
  ]
}
```

### 5.19 SubmitButton

**Category:** Display
**Level:** Core
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Forbidden

#### Description

A button that triggers the renderer's submit flow. When clicked, the
renderer collects the current form response, generates a validation
report in the configured `mode`, and either dispatches a
`formspec-submit` CustomEvent (when `emitEvent` is `true`) or calls
the host renderer's submit API directly.

While a submission is pending (the shared submit-pending state is
`true`), the button SHOULD display `pendingLabel` (when provided) in
place of `label`, and — unless `disableWhenPending` is `false` — MUST
be rendered in a disabled/inert state to prevent duplicate submissions.

SubmitButton has no `bind` relationship. It interacts with the form
as a whole, not with any individual item.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `label` | string | `"Submit"` | No | Button label text. |
| `mode` | string | `"submit"` | No | Validation mode used when clicked. MUST be one of `"continuous"` or `"submit"`. Controls which validation pass produces the report emitted with the event. |
| `emitEvent` | boolean | `false` | No | When `true`, clicking the button dispatches a `formspec-submit` CustomEvent whose `detail` carries the current response and validation report. |
| `pendingLabel` | string | — | No | Label text shown while the shared submit-pending state is `true`. Falls back to `label` when absent. |
| `disableWhenPending` | boolean | `true` | No | Whether the button is rendered in a disabled/inert state while the shared submit-pending state is `true`. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a native button element or equivalent accessible
  interactive control.
- MUST NOT accept a `bind` property.
- When clicked and `emitEvent` is `true`, MUST dispatch a
  `formspec-submit` CustomEvent on the host element.
- When the shared submit-pending state is `true`:
  - If `disableWhenPending` is `true`, MUST render the button as
    disabled/inert.
  - MUST display `pendingLabel` when present.

## 6. Built-In Components — Progressive (17)

This section defines the 17 Progressive components. A **Complete
Conformant** processor MUST support all 17. A **Core Conformant**
processor MUST substitute the specified Core fallback for each
Progressive component and SHOULD emit an informative warning.

Each Progressive component entry includes a **Fallback** line
identifying the Core component that replaces it in Core-level
processors. §6.18 provides a consolidated fallback table.

---

### 6.1 Columns

**Category:** Layout
**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** Yes
**Bind:** Forbidden
**Fallback:** Grid

#### Description

An explicit multi-column layout where each child occupies a column
whose width is specified by the `widths` array. Unlike Grid, which
auto-distributes children into equal cells, Columns gives precise
control over per-column sizing.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `widths` | array of strings | equal widths | No | Per-child column widths as CSS values (e.g., `["1fr", "2fr", "1fr"]` or `["200px", "auto"]`). Array length SHOULD match the number of children. |
| `gap` | string \| number | `0` | Yes | Spacing between columns. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render children side-by-side in the specified widths.
- When `widths` length differs from children count, MUST distribute
  remaining children into equal-width columns.

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace Columns with a **Grid** whose `columns`
prop equals the number of children. The `gap` prop is preserved.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Columns",
  "widths": ["2fr", "1fr"],
  "gap": "$token.spacing.md",
  "children": [
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "address" },
    { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "zipCode" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 6.2 Tabs

**Category:** Layout
**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** Yes
**Bind:** Forbidden
**Fallback:** Stack (each child preceded by a Heading)

#### Description

A tabbed navigation container. Each direct child represents the
content of one tab. Tab labels are derived from child Page `title`
props or from the `tabLabels` array.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `position` | string | `"top"` | No | Tab bar position. MUST be one of `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, or `"right"`. |
| `tabLabels` | array of strings | — | No | Explicit tab labels. When absent, the renderer reads `title` from each child (children SHOULD be Page components). |
| `defaultTab` | integer | `0` | No | Zero-based index of the initially active tab. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render a tab bar with one tab per direct child.
- MUST show exactly one child's content at a time.
- MUST allow the user to switch tabs by clicking tab labels.
- All children remain mounted; switching tabs changes visibility,
  not lifecycle. Bound data is preserved.

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace Tabs with a **Stack** (direction
`"vertical"`). Each child is preceded by a **Heading** (level 3)
whose text is the corresponding tab label. All children are rendered
visibly in sequence.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Tabs",
  "tabLabels": ["Personal", "Employment", "Review"],
  "children": [
    { "component": "Stack", "children": [
      { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "firstName" },
      { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "lastName" }
    ]},
    { "component": "Stack", "children": [
      { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "employer" }
    ]},
    { "component": "Stack", "children": [
      { "component": "Text", "text": "Please review your information." }
    ]}
  ]
}
```

---

### 6.3 Accordion

**Category:** Layout
**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** Yes
**Bind:** Optional (repeatable group key)
**Fallback:** Stack with Collapsible children

#### Description

A vertical list of collapsible sections where, by default, only one
section is expanded at a time. Each child SHOULD be a component with
a `title` prop (e.g., Page, Card, Collapsible) to serve as the
section header.

When `bind` is provided, it MUST reference a repeatable group item.
Each repeat instance becomes one accordion section. Child `bind`
values resolve relative to the repeat context.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `allowMultiple` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether multiple sections may be expanded simultaneously. When `false`, expanding one section collapses the others. |
| `defaultOpen` | integer | `0` | No | Zero-based index of the initially expanded section. |
| `labels` | string[] | — | No | Section header labels. `labels[i]` is the summary text for `children[i]`. Falls back to `"Section {i+1}"` when absent. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render each child as a collapsible panel with a clickable
  header.
- When `allowMultiple` is `false`, MUST enforce mutual exclusion
  (only one open at a time).
- MUST apply appropriate ARIA roles (`role="region"`,
  `aria-expanded`, etc.).

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace Accordion with a **Stack** where each
child is wrapped in a **Collapsible**. The first child's Collapsible
has `defaultOpen: true`; the rest have `defaultOpen: false`.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Accordion",
  "allowMultiple": false,
  "children": [
    { "component": "Page", "title": "Section A", "children": [
      { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "fieldA" }
    ]},
    { "component": "Page", "title": "Section B", "children": [
      { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "fieldB" }
    ]}
  ]
}
```

### 6.4 RadioGroup

**Category:** Input
**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `choice`
**Fallback:** Select

#### Description

A group of radio buttons for single-select choice fields. All options
are visible simultaneously, making RadioGroup suitable for short
option lists (typically ≤ 7 items).

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `columns` | integer | `1` | No | Number of columns to arrange radio buttons in. |
| `orientation` | string | `"vertical"` | No | Layout direction. MUST be `"vertical"` or `"horizontal"`. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render one radio button per option from the bound item's
  `options` or `optionSet`.
- MUST enforce single selection (selecting one deselects others).
- MUST propagate `required`, `readOnly`, and `relevant` state.
- MUST display validation errors.

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace RadioGroup with **Select**. The
`searchable` prop defaults to `false`. The `columns` prop is
discarded.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "RadioGroup",
  "bind": "priority",
  "columns": 3,
  "orientation": "horizontal"
}
```

---

**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `number`, `integer`
**Fallback:** NumberInput

#### Description

A currency-aware numeric input that displays a currency symbol and
formatted number. Stores the raw numeric value without currency
formatting.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `currency` | string | `"USD"` | No | ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., `"USD"`, `"EUR"`, `"GBP"`). |
| `showCurrency` | boolean | `true` | No | Whether to display the currency symbol. |
| `locale` | string | — | No | Locale for number/currency formatting (e.g., `"en-US"`). |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render a numeric input with the currency symbol.

  currency conventions.
- MUST store the raw numeric value (without formatting characters)
  in the data.
- MUST propagate `required`, `readOnly`, and `relevant` state.
- MUST display validation errors.

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace MoneyInput with **NumberInput**. The
currency symbol SHOULD be rendered as a prefix label adjacent to
the input if the bound item has a `prefix` presentation hint.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "MoneyInput",
  "bind": "totalBudget",
  "currency": "USD",
  "showCurrency": true
}
```

`max`, and `step` props are preserved on the NumberInput.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Slider",
  "bind": "satisfaction",
  "min": 1,
  "max": 10,
  "step": 1,
  "showValue": true
}
```

---

**Category:** Input
**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `integer`
**Fallback:** NumberInput

#### Description

A star (or icon) rating control for selecting an integer value

`min: 1`, `max` preserved, and `step: 1`.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Rating",
  "bind": "serviceRating",
  "max": 5,
  "icon": "star"
}
```

---

### 6.8 Signature

**Category:** Input
**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Required
**Compatible dataTypes:** `attachment`
**Fallback:** FileUpload

|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `value` | number | `0` | No | Current progress value. Ignored when `bind` is present. |
| `max` | number | `100` | No | Maximum value (100% completion). |
| `label` | string | — | No | Accessible label for the progress bar. |
| `showPercent` | boolean | `true` | No | Whether to display the percentage text. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a progress bar element (`<progress>` or equivalent).
- MUST compute the fill percentage as `value / max * 100`.
- MUST apply `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, and `aria-valuemax`.

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace ProgressBar with **Text** displaying

### 6.12 Summary

**Category:** Display
**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Forbidden
**Fallback:** Stack of Text components

#### Description

A key-value summary display that shows multiple field labels and

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `items` | array | — (REQUIRED) | No | Array of summary items. Each element is an object with `label` (string, REQUIRED), `bind` (string, REQUIRED — item key), and optional `optionSet` (string). |

Each item object in the `items` array supports:

| Item Field | Type | Required | Description |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| `label` | string | Yes | Display label shown next to the value. |
| `bind` | string | Yes | Path to the field whose value to display. |
| `optionSet` | string | No | Name of an option set defined in the form definition. When present, the raw bound value is resolved to its display label via the named option set. Use for `choice` and `multiChoice` fields. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a definition list, table, or equivalent key-value
  layout.
- For each entry in `items`, MUST display the `label` and the
  current value of the bound item.
- Values MUST be formatted according to the item's `dataType`.
- When `optionSet` is set on an item, renderers MUST look up the
  bound value in the named option set and display the matching
  `label`. If no match is found, the raw value SHOULD be displayed.

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace Summary with a **Stack** containing
one **Text** component per item, with `text` set to
`"<label>: <value>"`.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Summary",
  "items": [
    { "label": "Project Name", "bind": "projectName" },
    { "label": "Total Budget", "bind": "totalBudget" },

  ]
}
```

---

### 6.13 ValidationSummary

**Category:** Display
**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** No
**Bind:** Forbidden
**Fallback:** Alert (severity + message rows shown as warning/error alerts)

#### Description

A validation message panel that surfaces the current form validation
state. Can operate in `"live"` mode (reading continuous engine
state) or `"submit"` mode (reading the latest `formspec-submit`
event detail). Optionally renders jump links that invoke
`focusField(path)` on affected input fields.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `source` | string | `"live"` | No | Validation source. `"live"` reads continuous engine state; `"submit"` reads the latest `formspec-submit` event detail. |
| `mode` | string | `"continuous"` | No | Validation mode used when `source` is `"live"`. MUST be one of `"continuous"` or `"submit"`. |
| `showFieldErrors` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether to include bind-level field errors in addition to shape-level findings. |
| `jumpLinks` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether to render clickable links or buttons that call `focusField(path)` for jumpable targets. |
| `dedupe` | boolean | `true` | No | Whether duplicate messages (same severity, path, and message) are collapsed into a single row. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as a list or panel of validation messages.
- MUST display each finding's severity (error, warning, info) and
  message text.
- When `jumpLinks` is `true` and the finding has a `path`, MUST
  render a clickable control that calls `focusField(path)`.
- When `dedupe` is `true`, MUST collapse duplicate findings before
  rendering.
- When no findings are present, the component SHOULD render nothing
  (empty state) or a brief "No issues" indicator.

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace ValidationSummary with one or more
**Alert** components — one per validation finding, using the
finding's severity as the Alert `variant`.

#### Example

```json
{ "component": "ValidationSummary", "source": "submit", "jumpLinks": true, "showFieldErrors": true }
```

MAY use `bind` to reference a repeatable group.

#### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Token-able | Description |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `columns` | array | — (REQUIRED) | No | Array of column definitions. Each element is an object with `header` (string, REQUIRED) and `bind` (string, REQUIRED — item key within the repeat group). |
| `showRowNumbers` | boolean | `false` | No | Whether to display row numbers. |
| `allowAdd` | boolean | `true` | No | Whether to show an "Add row" control. |
| `allowRemove` | boolean | `true` | No | Whether to show per-row "Remove" controls. |

#### Rendering Requirements

- MUST render as an HTML table or equivalent tabular layout.
- MUST create one row per repeat instance.
- MUST render one cell per column definition, displaying the
  value of the bound field within that repeat instance.
- When `allowAdd` is `true`, MUST provide an "Add" affordance,
  subject to `maxRepeat` constraints.
- When `allowRemove` is `true`, MUST provide per-row "Remove"
  affordances, subject to `minRepeat` constraints.

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace DataTable with a **Stack** that repeats
a **Card** for each repeat instance. Within each Card, bound fields
are rendered as TextInput or appropriate Core components.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "DataTable",
  "bind": "lineItems",
  "columns": [
    { "header": "Description", "bind": "description" },
    { "header": "Amount", "bind": "amount" },

  "component": "Panel",
  "position": "left",
  "title": "Help",
  "width": "280px",
  "children": [
    { "component": "Text", "text": "Need help? Contact support." }
  ]
}
```

### 6.16 Modal

**Category:** Container
**Level:** Progressive
**Accepts children:** Yes
**Bind:** Forbidden
**Fallback:** Collapsible

#### Description

A dialog overlay that displays content in a modal window above the
main form. Modals require explicit user action to open and close.

  `closable` is `true`.
- MUST apply `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`.
- Content within the modal MUST be interactive (input components
  receive focus and accept input).

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace Modal with **Collapsible**. The `title`
prop is preserved. The modal's content is rendered as the
collapsible body, initially collapsed (`defaultOpen: false`).

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Modal",
  "title": "Terms and Conditions",
  "trigger": "button",
  "triggerLabel": "View Terms",
  "children": [
    { "component": "Text", "text": "By submitting this form, you agree to...", "format": "markdown" }

- SHOULD use native popover behavior when available.
- MUST provide a usable toggle fallback when native popover behavior is
  unavailable.

#### Fallback Behavior

Core processors MUST replace Popover with **Collapsible**. The
`triggerLabel` value SHOULD map to Collapsible `title`. The `placement`
property is discarded.

#### Example

```json
{
  "component": "Popover",
  "triggerBind": "projectName",
  "triggerLabel": "Show details",
  "placement": "right",
  "children": [
    { "component": "Text", "text": "Additional context for this field." }
  ]
}
```

### 6.18 Fallback Requirements

The following table defines the complete set of Progressive → Core
fallback substitutions. A Core Conformant processor MUST apply these
fallbacks when it encounters a Progressive component.

| Progressive Component | Core Fallback | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Columns | Grid | `columns` set to child count; `gap` preserved. |
| Tabs | Stack + Heading | Each child preceded by a Heading (level 3) with the tab label. |

| RadioGroup | Select | `columns` discarded. |
| MoneyInput | NumberInput | Currency symbol rendered as prefix if available. |
| Slider | NumberInput | `min`, `max`, `step` preserved. |
| Rating | NumberInput | `min: 1`, `max` preserved, `step: 1`. |
| Signature | FileUpload | `accept` set to `"image/*"`. |
| Alert | Text | Text prefixed with severity in brackets. |
| Badge | Text | Same `text` prop. |
| ProgressBar | Text | Text shows `"<value> / <max> (<percent>%)"`. |
| Summary | Stack of Text | One Text per item: `"<label>: <value>"`. |
| ValidationSummary | Alert | One Alert per finding; severity preserved as `variant`. |
| DataTable | Stack of Card | One Card per repeat instance with child inputs. |
| Panel | Card | `title` preserved; position/width discarded. |
| Modal | Collapsible | `title` preserved; `defaultOpen: false`. |
| Popover | Collapsible | `triggerLabel` mapped to `title`; placement discarded. |

Fallback substitution MUST preserve:

1. All child components (recursively processed).
2. The `when` property (transferred to the fallback component).
3. The `responsive` property (transferred if applicable props exist
   on the fallback).
4. The `style` property.
5. The `bind` property (when the fallback supports it).

Fallback substitution MUST discard props that have no equivalent on
the Core fallback component. Processors SHOULD emit a warning
listing discarded props.

---

## 7. Custom Components

The custom component mechanism allows authors to define reusable
component subtrees with parameterized interpolation. Custom components
promote consistency and reduce duplication in large component trees.

### 7.1 The components Registry

The top-level `components` property is an object whose keys are custom
component names and whose values are **component template** objects.

Each template object has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Cardinality | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params` | array of strings | **0..1** (OPTIONAL) | Parameter names accepted by this template. Each name MUST match `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`. |
| `tree` | object | **1..1** (REQUIRED) | The component subtree that is instantiated when this custom component is used. |

Custom component names MUST match `[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*` (PascalCase,
starting with uppercase). Names MUST NOT collide with built-in
component names (§5, §6). Names beginning with `x-` are reserved for
vendor extensions (§13.3).

Example registry:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "LabeledField": {
      "params": ["field", "label"],
      "tree": {
        "component": "Stack",
        "gap": "$token.spacing.sm",
        "children": [
          { "component": "Heading", "level": 4, "text": "{label}" },
          { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "{field}" }
        ]
      }
    },
    "AddressBlock": {
      "params": ["prefix"],
      "tree": {
        "component": "Card",
        "title": "Address",
        "children": [
          { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "{prefix}Street" },
          { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "{prefix}City" },
          { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "{prefix}State" },
          { "component": "TextInput", "bind": "{prefix}Zip" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 7.2 {param} Interpolation Grammar (ABNF)

Parameter interpolation uses `{paramName}` syntax within string-valued
props. The following ABNF grammar defines the interpolation syntax:

```abnf
interpolated-string = *( literal-segment / param-ref / escaped-brace )
literal-segment     = 1*( %x00-7A / %x7C-7C / %x7E-10FFFF )  ; any char except { }
param-ref           = "{" param-name "}"
param-name          = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" )
escaped-brace       = "{{" / "}}"
```

Rules:

1. `{paramName}` is replaced with the corresponding parameter value
   from the instantiation's `params` object.
2. `{{` produces a literal `{` in the output.
3. `}}` produces a literal `}` in the output.
4. Nesting is NOT allowed: `{outer_{inner}}` is invalid.
5. An unrecognized `{name}` (where `name` is not in the template's
   `params` array) MUST cause a validation error.

Interpolation is permitted in the following prop types ONLY:

| Allowed | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| `bind` | `"bind": "{prefix}Street"` |
| `when` | `"when": "${field} != null"` |
| `text` (on Text, Heading, Alert, Badge) | `"text": "Address for {label}"` |
| `title` (on Page, Card, Collapsible, etc.) | `"title": "{sectionTitle}"` |
| `placeholder` | `"placeholder": "Enter {label}"` |
| `label` (on Divider) | `"label": "{section}"` |
| `fallback` (on ConditionalGroup) | `"fallback": "No {item} available"` |

Interpolation is FORBIDDEN in:

| Forbidden | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `component` | Component type switching creates ambiguous trees. |
| `$token.*` references | Token resolution is a separate phase. |
| Numeric props (`min`, `max`, `step`, `columns`, etc.) | Type safety. |
| Boolean props (`searchable`, `showProgress`, etc.) | Type safety. |
| `style` keys or values | Style resolution is a separate phase. |

### 7.3 Instantiation

A custom component is instantiated by using its registry name as the
`component` value and providing parameter values in a `params` object:

```json
{
  "component": "AddressBlock",
  "params": { "prefix": "home" }
}
```

The processor MUST:

1. Look up the component name in the `components` registry.
2. Verify that all declared params have corresponding values in the
   instantiation's `params` object. Missing params MUST cause a
   validation error.
3. Deep-clone the template's `tree`.
4. Replace all `{paramName}` occurrences in allowed string props
   with the corresponding values from `params`.
5. Insert the resolved subtree in place of the custom component
   reference.

Extra params (keys in the instantiation's `params` that are not
declared in the template's `params` array) MUST be ignored. Processors
SHOULD emit a warning.

The instantiation MAY also include `when`, `style`, and `responsive`
props. These are applied to the **root** of the resolved subtree
(merged on top of whatever the template already defines).

### 7.4 Recursion Prohibition and Cycle Detection

Custom component templates MUST NOT reference themselves, directly or
indirectly. A cycle occurs when template A's tree instantiates
template B, and template B's tree instantiates template A (or any
longer chain that forms a loop).

Processors MUST perform static cycle detection at validation time by
building a directed graph of template references and checking for
cycles. Cycle detection MUST be performed regardless of parameter
values — the analysis is structural, not data-dependent.

Documents containing recursive custom components MUST be rejected.

### 7.5 Depth Limits

Custom component nesting (template A instantiates template B which
instantiates template C) SHOULD NOT exceed **3 levels** of custom
component expansion.

The total tree depth (including both built-in and expanded custom
components) SHOULD NOT exceed **20 levels**.

Processors MAY enforce stricter limits. Processors MUST NOT enforce
limits lower than 3 levels of custom nesting or 10 levels of total
tree depth.

---

## 8. Conditional Rendering

The `when` property enables components to be conditionally shown or
hidden based on the current data state, without affecting the data
model.

### 8.1 The when Property

The `when` property is a **FEL boolean expression** (fel-grammar.md).
When present on a component:

1. The processor MUST evaluate the expression against the current
   data tree.
2. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the component (and all
   its children) MUST be rendered.
3. If the expression evaluates to `false`, `null`, or any non-boolean
   value, the component (and all its children) MUST be hidden.

The `when` property is OPTIONAL on all components except
**ConditionalGroup** (§5.18), where it is REQUIRED.

Multiple `when` conditions do NOT chain — each component has at most
one `when` expression. To express compound conditions, use FEL
logical operators within the expression:

```json
{ "component": "TextInput", "bind": "spouseName",
  "when": "$maritalStatus = 'married' and $age >= 18" }
```

### 8.2 Distinction from Bind relevant

The `when` property and the Definition Bind's `relevant` expression
serve **different purposes**:

| Aspect | `when` (Component) | `relevant` (Bind) |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Scope** | Visual presentation only | Data model inclusion |
| **Data effect** | None — hidden component's bound data is preserved | Non-relevant data MAY be removed from the Instance (per `nonRelevantBehavior`) |
| **Defined in** | Component Document (Tier 3) | Definition (Tier 1, Binds) |
| **Evaluation** | FEL against data tree | FEL against data tree |
| **Override** | Cannot override `relevant` | Cannot be overridden by `when` |

When BOTH `when` and `relevant` apply to the same bound item:

- If `relevant` is `false`, the component is hidden **regardless**
  of `when`. The Bind `relevant` takes precedence.
- If `relevant` is `true` and `when` is `false`, the component is
  hidden but the data remains in the Instance.
- If both are `true`, the component is visible.

### 8.3 FEL Evaluation Context

FEL expressions in `when` ALWAYS resolve against the **data tree**
(the Formspec Instance):

- `$fieldKey` resolves to the current value of the field with that
  key.
- `@index` resolves to the 1-based repeat index when inside a
  repeatable group context.
- `@count` resolves to the total number of repeat instances when
  inside a repeatable group context.
- Standard FEL functions and operators are available.

FEL expressions MUST NOT reference component props, component state,
or presentation-layer values. The evaluation context is strictly the
data model.

### 8.4 Error Handling

When a `when` expression is **malformed** (syntax error, unresolved
function, type error):

1. The processor MUST hide the component (treat as `false`).
2. The processor MUST emit a warning identifying the component and
   the expression error.
3. The processor MUST NOT halt form rendering due to a `when`
   evaluation error.

When a `when` expression references an item key that does not exist
in the Definition:

1. The missing reference evaluates to `null` per FEL semantics.
2. The component is hidden (null → falsy).
3. The processor SHOULD emit a warning.

---

## 9. Responsive Design

The responsive system allows component props to vary by viewport
width, enabling adaptive layouts from a single Component Document.

### 9.1 Breakpoints Declaration

Breakpoints are declared in the top-level `breakpoints` object. Each
key is a breakpoint name; each value is the minimum viewport width in
pixels at which that breakpoint activates.

```json
{
  "breakpoints": {
    "sm": 576,
    "md": 768,
    "lg": 1024,
    "xl": 1280
  }
}
```

Breakpoint names MUST be non-empty strings. Values MUST be
non-negative integers. The same breakpoint format is used in the
Theme Specification (theme-spec §6.4).

When a Component Document and a Theme Document both declare
`breakpoints` for the same Definition, the Component Document's
breakpoints take precedence.

### 9.2 The responsive Property

The `responsive` property on a component object is a JSON object
whose keys are breakpoint names and whose values are **prop override
objects**:

```json
{
  "component": "Grid",
  "columns": 3,
  "gap": "$token.spacing.md",
  "responsive": {
    "sm": { "columns": 1, "gap": "$token.spacing.sm" },
    "md": { "columns": 2 }
  }
}
```

Override objects contain **component-specific props only** (not base
props). The following properties MUST NOT appear in responsive
overrides:

- `component` — type switching is forbidden (§9.4).
- `bind` — data binding is viewport-independent.
- `when` — conditions are viewport-independent.
- `children` — tree structure is viewport-independent.
- `responsive` — recursive responsive is forbidden.

The `style` property MAY appear in responsive overrides.

### 9.3 Merge Semantics (mobile-first)

Responsive overrides follow a **mobile-first cascade**:

1. **Base props** apply to all viewport widths (including the
   smallest).
2. At each breakpoint (in ascending min-width order), the
   corresponding override object is **shallow-merged** on top of
   the base props.
3. Each override replaces individual props; it does not deep-merge
   nested objects. A `style` override replaces the entire `style`
   object for that breakpoint.

Resolution algorithm:

```
function resolveProps(component, viewportWidth, breakpoints):
  resolved = copy(component.baseProps)

  // Sort breakpoints by minWidth ascending
  sorted = sortByValue(breakpoints)

  for each (name, minWidth) in sorted:
    if viewportWidth >= minWidth:
      if component.responsive[name] exists:
        shallowMerge(resolved, component.responsive[name])

  return resolved
```

Example: with breakpoints `{"sm": 576, "md": 768}` and the Grid
example above, at viewport width 700px:

- Base: `columns: 3, gap: "$token.spacing.md"`
- After `sm` (576 ≤ 700): `columns: 1, gap: "$token.spacing.sm"`
- `md` does not apply (768 > 700)
- Result: `columns: 1, gap: "$token.spacing.sm"`

### 9.4 Structural Constraints

Responsive overrides MUST NOT alter the structural identity of a
component:

1. The `component` type MUST NOT change per breakpoint.
2. The `children` array MUST NOT change per breakpoint (no adding,
   removing, or reordering children).
3. The `bind` property MUST NOT change per breakpoint.

These constraints ensure that the component tree is structurally
stable across all viewport widths. Only **presentational props**
(layout, spacing, visibility hints) may vary.

---

## 10. Theming and Design Tokens

Component Documents support design tokens for visual consistency.
Tokens defined in a Component Document follow the same format as
Tokens in the Theme Specification (theme-spec §3).

### 10.1 The tokens Map

The `tokens` object is a flat key-value map. Keys are dot-delimited
names; values are strings or numbers.

```json
{
  "tokens": {
    "color.primary": "#0057B7",
    "color.error": "#D32F2F",
    "spacing.sm": "8px",
    "spacing.md": "16px",
    "spacing.lg": "24px",
    "border.radius": "6px"
  }
}
```

Token keys MUST be non-empty strings. Token values MUST be strings
or numbers. Tokens MUST NOT contain nested objects, arrays, booleans,
or null.

The token format is identical to theme-spec §3.1. The RECOMMENDED
category prefixes (`color.`, `spacing.`, `typography.`, `border.`,
`elevation.`, `x-`) from theme-spec §3.2 apply here as well.

### 10.2 $token.path References

Tokens are referenced in `style` objects and token-able props using
the `$token.` prefix:

```
$token.<key>
```

Examples:

- `"gap": "$token.spacing.md"` resolves to `"16px"`.
- `"style": { "borderRadius": "$token.border.radius" }` resolves to
  `"6px"`.

The reference syntax is identical to theme-spec §3.3. Token
references MUST NOT be recursive (a token value MUST NOT itself
contain a `$token.` reference).

### 10.3 Cross-Tier Token Cascade

When both a Component Document and a Theme Document define tokens
for the same Definition, the following cascade applies:

| Priority | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 (highest) | Component Document `tokens` | Tier 3 tokens. |
| 2 | Theme Document `tokens` | Tier 2 tokens. |
| 3 (lowest) | Renderer defaults | Platform/implementation defaults. |

Resolution:

1. When a `$token.key` reference is encountered in the Component
   Document, look up `key` in the Component Document's `tokens`.
2. If NOT found, look up `key` in the Theme Document's `tokens`.
3. If NOT found, use the renderer's default value.

This cascade allows Component Documents to override specific theme
tokens while inheriting the rest.

### 10.4 Unresolved Token Handling

When a `$token.` reference cannot be resolved through the cascade
(not found in Component tokens, Theme tokens, or renderer defaults):

1. The processor MUST use a reasonable platform-appropriate default.
2. The processor SHOULD emit a warning identifying the unresolved
   token reference.
3. The processor MUST NOT fail or halt rendering.

### 10.5 CSS Custom Property Emission (Web Renderers)

Web renderers SHOULD emit resolved theme tokens as CSS custom properties
on the form's root container element. The recommended naming convention
is:

```
--formspec-{token-key-with-dots-replaced-by-hyphens}
```

For example, a theme token `color.primary` with value `#005ea2` SHOULD
be emitted as:

```css
--formspec-color-primary: #005ea2;
```

This enables external CSS — including design-system bridge stylesheets
and author-defined overrides — to reference theme tokens without
JavaScript coupling. Bridge CSS can use `var(--formspec-color-primary)`
to stay in sync with the active theme.

Renderers that emit CSS custom properties SHOULD update them when the
theme document changes. Renderers MAY also emit tokens from the
Component Document's `tokens` map, with component tokens taking
precedence over theme tokens for identically named properties.

Non-web renderers (PDF, native) MAY ignore this convention entirely.

---

## 11. Cross-Tier Interaction

This section defines how Tier 3 (Component Documents) interacts with
Tier 2 (Themes) and Tier 1 (Definition presentation hints) in a
multi-tier presentation stack.

### 11.1 Tier 1 Fallback for Unbound Items

When an item in the Definition is NOT bound to any component in the
tree, the renderer falls back to lower tiers:

1. **Tier 2 (Theme):** If a Theme Document is present and defines
   a widget/layout for the unbound item (via selectors or per-item
   overrides), use the theme's configuration.
2. **Tier 1 (Definition hints):** If no Theme applies, use the
   item's `presentation` hints (core §4.2.5) to select a widget
   and configure rendering.
3. **Renderer defaults:** If no hints are available, use the
   renderer's default widget for the item's `dataType`.

Fallback rendering for unbound items follows the rules in §4.5.

### 11.2 Tier 2 Token Inheritance

Component Documents inherit tokens from an associated Theme Document.
When a Component Document references `$token.color.primary` and does
NOT define that token in its own `tokens` map, the resolution falls
through to the Theme's `tokens` map (§10.3).

This enables a common pattern: the Theme defines the design system
tokens (colors, spacing, typography), and the Component Document
references them without redeclaring.

A Component Document MAY override specific tokens to customize the
appearance without diverging from the theme entirely.

### 11.3 Precedence: Tier 3 > Tier 2 > Tier 1

The general precedence rule for all presentation decisions:

| Priority | Tier | Effect |
|----------|------|--------|
| 1 (highest) | **Tier 3 — Component Document** | Component tree layout, component selection, style, and tokens override everything below. |
| 2 | **Tier 2 — Theme Document** | Widget configuration, selector cascade, tokens, and page layout apply to items NOT controlled by Tier 3. Tier 2 tokens are inherited by Tier 3 (§10.3). |
| 3 (lowest) | **Tier 1 — Definition hints** | Inline `presentation` and `formPresentation` hints serve as baseline defaults. |

Specific interactions:

- **Widget selection:** Tier 3 component type overrides Tier 2 widget
  assignment, which overrides Tier 1 `widgetHint`.
- **Label display:** Tier 1 item `label` is the source of truth.
  Context-specific labels use the `labels` map on the Definition item.
- **Layout:** Tier 3 component tree completely replaces Tier 2 page
  layout for bound items.
- **Tokens:** Tier 3 tokens override Tier 2 tokens of the same key;
  unoverridden tokens cascade from Tier 2.
- **Behavioral rules:** `required`, `readOnly`, `relevant`,
  `constraint`, and `calculate` from the Definition are **never**
  overridden by any presentation tier. They always apply.

### 11.4 Partial Component Trees

A Component Document is NOT required to bind every item in the
Definition. A **partial tree** binds only a subset of items. The
remaining items are rendered via Tier 2/Tier 1 fallback (§11.1,
§4.5).

This enables incremental adoption: an author can create a Component
Document that controls the layout of key sections while allowing
simpler fields to render automatically.

The renderer MUST:

1. Render the component tree's output first.
2. Identify all Definition items not bound in the tree.
3. Render unbound visible items using fallback rules, appended after
   the tree output.
4. Ensure all required items are editable, regardless of whether
   they appear in the tree.

---

## 12. Validation and Conformance

This section defines the validation requirements for Component
Documents and the conformance criteria for processors.

### 12.1 Structural Validation (JSON Schema)

A conforming processor MUST validate a Component Document against
the structural rules defined in this specification. These rules MAY
be expressed as a JSON Schema (`component.schema.json`) for tooling
purposes.

Structural validation MUST verify:

1. **Required properties:** `$formspecComponent`, `version`,
   `targetDefinition`, and `tree` are present.
2. **Type correctness:** Each property has the correct JSON type
   (string, object, array, integer, boolean) as specified.
3. **Enum constraints:** Properties with enumerated values
   (`direction`, `align`, `severity`, `position`, etc.) contain
   valid values.
4. **Component names:** Every `component` value is either a built-in
   name (§5, §6) or a key in the `components` registry.
5. **Children constraints:** Components that do not accept children
   (§3.4) do not have a `children` property.
6. **ConditionalGroup `when`:** ConditionalGroup components include
   a `when` property.
7. **Heading props:** `level` is 1–6 and `text` is present.

Structural validation MUST be performed before referential integrity
checks (§12.2).

### 12.2 Referential Integrity

After structural validation passes, processors MUST verify referential
integrity:

1. **Bind keys:** Every `bind` value MUST correspond to an item `key`
   in the target Definition. Unknown bind keys MUST produce a warning.
   Processors SHOULD reject documents with bind keys that reference
   non-existent items, or MAY treat them as non-fatal warnings.

2. **Token references:** Every `$token.key` reference SHOULD resolve
   to a token in the Component Document's `tokens` map, the Theme
   Document's `tokens` map, or be a well-known renderer default.
   Unresolvable token references MUST produce a warning (§10.4).

3. **Custom component references:** Every `component` value that is
   not a built-in name MUST exist as a key in the `components`
   registry. References to undefined custom components MUST be
   rejected.

4. **Custom component params:** When instantiating a custom component,
   every param declared in the template's `params` array MUST have
   a corresponding entry in the instantiation's `params` object.
   Missing params MUST be rejected.

5. **Summary and DataTable bind refs:** The `bind` values within
   Summary `items` and DataTable `columns` MUST reference valid
   item keys.

6. **Cycle-free custom components:** The custom component dependency
   graph MUST be acyclic (§7.4).

### 12.3 Compatibility Validation

Processors MUST verify that each Input component's bound item has a
compatible `dataType`, per the matrix in §4.6:

1. Look up the bound item's `dataType` in the Definition.
2. Check the component's compatible dataTypes list.
3. If the dataType is NOT in the list, emit a validation error.

Incompatible bindings SHOULD be treated as errors. Processors MAY
continue rendering with a warning, using the component as-is and
relying on the renderer's type coercion, but this behavior is NOT
RECOMMENDED.

### 12.4 Conformance Levels: Core / Complete

A processor declares conformance at one of two levels:

**Core Conformant:**

- MUST parse and validate all Component Document properties defined
  in this specification.
- MUST render all 18 Core components (§5) with full prop support.
- MUST apply fallback substitution (§6.18) for all 17 Progressive
  components.
- MUST support custom component expansion (§7).
- MUST evaluate `when` expressions (§8).
- MUST support `responsive` prop overrides (§9).
- MUST resolve `$token.` references (§10).
- MUST implement bind resolution rules (§4).

**Complete Conformant:**

- MUST satisfy all Core Conformant requirements.
- MUST additionally render all 17 Progressive components (§6)
  natively, without fallback substitution.

Processors SHOULD declare their conformance level in their
documentation.

---

## 13. Complexity Controls

Formspec Component Documents are intentionally constrained to maintain
predictability, portability, and ease of implementation. This section
catalogues excluded features and the guard rails that keep Component
Documents declarative.

### 13.1 Excluded Features

The following features are **explicitly excluded** from this
specification. They MUST NOT be implemented as normative behavior by
conforming processors.

| Excluded Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Imperative event handlers / scripting** | Component Documents are declarative data, not programs. No `onClick`, `onChange`, or embedded JavaScript/FEL imperative code. |
| **Conditional component type switching** | The `component` prop MUST NOT vary by condition, breakpoint, or parameter. Structural ambiguity prevents static analysis. |
| **Recursive custom components** | Self-referencing templates produce unbounded trees. Prohibited and statically detected (§7.4). |
| **Computed props via FEL** | FEL is used ONLY in `when` conditions and display `text` interpolation. Props like `columns`, `min`, `max` MUST NOT be FEL expressions. |
| **Arbitrary slot projection / transclusion** | Components do not have named slots or content projection beyond `children`. This avoids the complexity of Angular/Vue-style slot APIs. |
| **Animation specifications** | Transitions, keyframes, and timing functions are out of scope. Renderers MAY animate independently. |
| **Server-side data fetching** | Component Documents MUST NOT trigger HTTP requests, API calls, or data loading. All data is provided by the Formspec Instance. |
| **Component inheritance** | No `extends` or prototype-chain mechanism for component types. Use custom components (§7) for reuse. |
| **Dynamic component registration** | The `components` registry is static. Components MUST NOT be added or removed at runtime. |
| **Deep responsive (children swap)** | Responsive overrides MUST NOT alter `children`, `bind`, or `component` type (§9.4). Only presentational props may vary. |

### 13.2 Guard Rails

The following limits protect processors and authors from excessive
complexity:

| Guard Rail | Limit | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| **Total tree depth** | SHOULD NOT exceed 20 levels. | Processors MAY reject deeper trees. MUST NOT enforce limits below 10. |
| **Custom component nesting** | SHOULD NOT exceed 3 levels of expansion. | Processors MAY reject deeper nesting. |
| **Single `when` per component** | Each component has at most one `when` expression. | Use FEL `and`/`or` for compound conditions. |
| **String-only params** | Custom component `params` values MUST be strings. | No objects, arrays, numbers, or booleans as param values. |
| **No param interpolation in type names** | `{param}` MUST NOT appear in the `component` property. | Prevents dynamic dispatch. |
| **Flat token map** | Tokens are a single-level key-value map. | No nested token groups or computed tokens. |
| **Editable uniqueness** | At most one editable Input per item key (§4.3). | Prevents conflicting write paths. |
| **Static tree** | The component tree structure is fixed at authoring time. | `when` hides/shows but does not add/remove nodes. |

### 13.3 Extension Mechanism

Vendor-specific or experimental features MAY be introduced using the
`x-` prefix convention:

1. **Custom component names:** Names starting with `x-` (e.g.,
   `x-MapPicker`, `x-SignaturePad`) MAY be used in the `components`
   registry. Conforming processors MUST NOT assign built-in semantics
   to `x-` prefixed names.

2. **Extension properties:** Top-level properties starting with `x-`
   are reserved for extensions. Processors MUST ignore unrecognized
   `x-` properties.

3. **Custom style keys:** Style object keys starting with `x-` are
   vendor-specific. Processors MUST ignore unrecognized `x-` style
   keys.

4. **Custom token prefixes:** Token keys starting with `x-` follow
   the same convention as theme-spec §3.5.

Extension features MUST NOT be required for correct rendering of
Core or Progressive components. An `x-` feature that is absent or
unsupported MUST NOT cause a processing failure.

---

## Appendix A: Full Example — Budget Form

This appendix is **informative**.

The following Component Document defines a multi-page layout for a
budget submission form. It targets a Definition with items for project
information, budget line items, and approval. Wizard-style navigation
is controlled by `formPresentation.pageMode` in the Definition, not
by the component tree structure.

This example demonstrates:

- **Stack with three Pages** for multi-page layout (wizard behavior via `formPresentation.pageMode`).
- **Custom component** (`AddressBlock`) for reusable address entry.
- **Responsive Grid** that collapses to single-column on small screens.
- **DataTable** bound to a repeatable group (`lineItems`).
- **Progressive components** (MoneyInput, DataTable, Summary, Alert,
  Signature) with defined Core fallbacks.
- **Conditional rendering** (`when` on Alert and ConditionalGroup).
- **Design tokens** referenced in gap and style properties.
- **Cross-tier token cascade** (component tokens override theme tokens).

## Appendix C: DataType ↔ Component Compatibility

This appendix is **normative**.

The following matrix shows which Input components are compatible with
each Definition `dataType`. A ✓ indicates compatibility. Components
marked (P) are Progressive; all others are Core.

| dataType | TextInput | NumberInput | DatePicker | Select | CheckboxGroup | Toggle | FileUpload | RadioGroup (P) | MoneyInput (P) | Slider (P) | Rating (P) | Signature (P) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `string` | ✓ | | | | | | | | | | | |
| `number` | | ✓ | | | | | | | | ✓ | | |
| `integer` | | ✓ | | | | | | | | ✓ | ✓ | |
| `boolean` | | | | | | ✓ | | | | | | |
| `date` | | | ✓ | | | | | | | | | |
| `dateTime` | | | ✓ | | | | | | | | | |
| `time` | | | ✓ | | | | | | | | | |
| `choice` | | | | ✓ | | | | ✓ | | | | |
| `multiChoice` | | | | ✓ | ✓ | | | | | | | |
| `attachment` | | | | | | | ✓ | | | | | ✓ |

Notes:

- **Display components** (Text, Heading, Summary, etc.) are compatible
  with ALL dataTypes when used in read-only `bind` mode. They are
  omitted from this matrix because they do not perform data editing.
- **MoneyInput** is compatible with `number` and `integer`. It adds
  currency formatting on top of NumberInput's capabilities. Authors
  SHOULD use MoneyInput when the Definition item has a `prefix` of
  `"$"`, `"€"`, or similar currency indicator.
- **TextInput** MAY be used as a universal fallback for any dataType
  in exceptional cases, but processors SHOULD warn about the type
  mismatch.
- **Select** on `multiChoice` MUST use `multiple` so the value is an array;
  otherwise the binding does not match the item's data type.
