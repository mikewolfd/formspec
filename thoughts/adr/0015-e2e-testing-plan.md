# ADR 0015: End-to-End Testing Plan

## Status
Implemented — 4 missing FEL functions remain (countWhere, string, boolean, date casts)

This document outlines the strategy for end-to-end (E2E) testing the Formspec standard.

## 1. Philosophy: Prove Implementability

As a declarative standard, testing Formspec's validity requires proving it can successfully drive a real-world user interface. A purely headless Python state machine validates the math but not the developer experience or the completeness of the presentation layer.

Our E2E testing strategy is to build a **Reference Implementation** using Web Components and test it using a real browser automation framework.

This achieves three goals:
1.  **Validates Tier 1 (Core):** Proves the data model, validation rules, and FEL expressions work in practice.
2.  **Validates Tiers 2 & 3 (Theme/Components):** Proves the presentation hints and component models cleanly map to actual DOM structures and CSS.
3.  **Provides a Reference:** Gives adopters a working codebase showing exactly how to implement the standard, accelerating adoption.

## 2. Architecture

The E2E suite will consist of three layers:

### Layer A: Core State Engine (TypeScript)
A framework-agnostic library that manages form state.
*   **Input:** A Formspec JSON definition.
*   **State Tree:** Maintains the current data values and metadata (touched, dirty, valid).
*   **Reactivity:** Re-evaluates FEL expressions (`calculate`, `visible`, `valid`) when dependencies change.
*   **Output:** Generates standard `Response` and `ValidationReport` JSON documents.

*Architectural Note: Porting the Python FEL evaluator to TypeScript represents a dual-maintenance burden. However, since the majority of Formspec adopters will build web UIs, a JavaScript/TypeScript reference implementation of FEL and the State Engine is arguably a necessity for the standard's success. We will use a lightweight reactivity primitive (`@preact/signals-core`) rather than reinventing reactive state management from scratch.*

### Layer B: Web Component Renderer (HTML/JS)
A custom element (`<formspec-render>`) that binds the State Engine to the DOM.
*   Parses the Formspec definition and dynamically generates native HTML input widgets.
*   Maps Tier 2 (Theme) properties to CSS custom properties (variables) or utility classes.
*   Maps Tier 3 (Components) to specific DOM structures (e.g., date pickers, select dropdowns).
*   Listens to DOM `input` events, updates the State Engine, and reactively updates the DOM (e.g., hiding/showing fields based on FEL).

### Layer C: Browser Automation (Playwright)
The actual E2E tests driving the browser.
*   Loads a test harness HTML page with specific Formspec JSON fixtures.
*   Simulates user interactions (typing, clicking, submitting).
*   Asserts DOM state (e.g., "Is the 'spouse name' field visible in the DOM?").
*   Asserts standard compliance (e.g., "Did the form generate a valid `response.schema.json` upon submission?").

## 3. Implementation Phases & Current Status

### Phase 1: Core JavaScript State Engine & FEL Scaffold (✅ COMPLETE)
1.  Built the reactive state manager that tracks values, paths, and validation errors using `@preact/signals-core`.
2.  Implemented a lightweight JIT compiler for FEL that converts basic math and logical expressions into JS Closures.

### Phase 2: The `<formspec-render>` Web Component (✅ COMPLETE)
1.  Created the zero-dependency custom element.
2.  Implemented basic field rendering (text, number, group).
3.  Wired up two-way data binding between the DOM inputs and the State Engine.
4.  Implemented dynamic visibility, calculated values, and repeating DOM instances.

### Phase 3: Playwright Test Harness (✅ COMPLETE)
1.  Set up Playwright with a Vite Dev Server.
2.  Created a directory of JSON Formspec fixtures representing complex scenarios.
3.  Wrote test suite covering repeating groups, visibility, dynamic calculations, pattern matching, and spec schema compliance.

### Phase 4: Exhaustive E2E Test Authoring (Red Phase) (✅ COMPLETE)
1.  **Exhaustive Fixtures:** Created JSON Formspec fixtures covering core standard FEL functions (e.g., `sum()`, `round()`).
2.  **Type Coverage Tests:** Wrote Playwright specs for `boolean` (checkboxes), `choice` (select/radio), and `date` (datepickers).
3.  **Array Aggregation Tests:** Wrote tests asserting that `calculate: "sum(items.price)"` evaluates correctly across dynamically added repeating DOM nodes.
4.  **Edge Case Tests:** Added specs covering Null Propagation, Deep Pruning, Validation Bypassing, and Strict Type Coercion.

### Phase 5: MVP Engine & Component Implementation (Green Phase) (✅ COMPLETE)
1.  **Standard Library Skeleton:** Implemented 8 core FEL standard functions required by the test suite.
2.  **Full Component Mapping:** Expanded the `<formspec-render>` Web Component to natively map DOM nodes to checkboxes, datepickers, and selects.
3.  **Cross-Field DOM Arrays:** Implemented reactive array collection so that adding a new DOM row automatically triggers the `sum()` recalculation.
4.  **Verification:** The entire E2E suite passes cleanly against the MVP reference implementation.

### Phase 6: Achieving 100% JavaScript Implementation Parity (⏳ PENDING)
While the E2E framework completely validates the architecture and core standard, the Javascript packages themselves are currently an advanced MVP. To reach 100% parity with the Python Core Reference (Layer 6), the following must be explicitly implemented:

1.  **Complete the FEL Standard Library:** Port the remaining standard functions from `src/fel/functions.py` into the TypeScript `compileFEL()` scope:
    *   **Aggregates:** `count`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `countWhere`
    *   **Strings:** `length`, `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `substring`, `replace`, `lower`, `trim`, `matches`, `format`
    *   **Math:** `floor`, `ceil`, `abs`, `power`
    *   **Dates & Time:** `today`, `now`, `month`, `day`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, `time`, `timeDiff`, `dateDiff`, `dateAdd`
    *   **Logical / Type:** `if`, `empty`, `selected`, `isNumber`, `isString`, `isDate`, `typeOf`
    *   **Cast:** `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `date`
    *   **Money:** `money`, `moneyAmount`, `moneyCurrency`, `moneyAdd`, `moneySum`
    *   **Context / Navigation:** `prev`, `next`, `parent`
2.  **Implement Cyclic Dependency Detection:** The state engine must map the dependency graph (DAG) during `initializeSignals()`. If a form definition contains `calculate: "b"` on field A, and `calculate: "a"` on field B, it must throw a terminal error rather than letting `@preact/signals-core` enter an infinite browser-crashing loop.
3.  **Advanced Tier 3 Components:** The `<formspec-render>` Web Component must expand beyond standard HTML inputs to handle remote REST API binding for `choice` schemas.
4.  **Add Corresponding E2E Tests:** For every newly ported function listed above, append a test case to `tests/e2e/playwright/fel-functions.spec.ts` asserting strict compliance.

## 4. Key E2E Scenarios Automated

*   **Static Validation:** Typing invalid data (e.g., failing a `pattern` regex) immediately shows an error message and prevents valid submission.
*   **Dynamic Calculation:** Typing a `price` and `quantity` immediately updates a readonly `total` field via FEL.
*   **Conditional Visibility:** Toggling a checkbox unhides a nested section of the form; when hidden, the nested data is strictly omitted/pruned from the final `response.schema.json` as dictated by the spec.
*   **Repeating Sections:** Adding multiple instances of an item block, verifying `$index` contextual FEL variables work, and aggregating data across instances.
*   **Cross-field Validation:** Ensuring an `endDate` input cannot precede a `startDate` input, with the error state correctly attached to the `endDate` DOM element in the generated `ValidationReport`.
