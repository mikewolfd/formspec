# ADR-0022: Component Playground Strategy (Off-the-Shelf vs Custom)

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2026-02-24  
**Authors**: Codex (AI), exedev  
**Deciders**: exedev  
**Depends on**: [ADR-0019: Theme Cascade Implementation and Default Theme](0019-theme-cascade-default-theme.md), [ADR-0020: CSS Integration and Design System Interop](0020-css-integration-and-design-system-interop.md), [ADR-0021: Holistic Kitchen-Sink E2E Conformance Plan](0021-holistic-kitchen-sink-e2e-conformance-plan.md)

## 1. Context and Problem Statement

We need a developer-facing playground for Formspec rendering that supports real authoring workflows, not only isolated component screenshots.

The playground must let users iterate on:

- definition/theme/component documents together
- FEL-driven behavior and validation feedback
- repeat/wizard/non-relevant behavior under real engine state transitions
- deterministic scenario replay aligned with conformance testing

This is broader than a visual component gallery. Formspec components are behaviorally coupled to the engine and definition semantics, so static prop-driven demos are insufficient for many failure modes.

## 2. Decision Drivers

- **Runtime fidelity**: mirror actual `<formspec-render>` + `FormEngine` behavior.
- **Spec-centric workflow**: edit JSON artifacts, not framework props.
- **Determinism for test reuse**: same scenario should be playable in manual and automated runs.
- **Low integration friction**: we already run Vite and Playwright in-repo.
- **Maintenance cost**: avoid heavy tooling overhead that does not map to Formspec semantics.
- **Future extensibility**: leave room for visual catalog/documentation growth without locking architecture.

## 3. Considered Options

### Option A: Off-the-shelf playground (Storybook web-components)

Use Storybook (`@storybook/web-components-vite`) as the primary playground.

Pros:
- mature UI shell, docs pages, controls, addon ecosystem
- built-in visual review workflows
- fast initial setup for isolated visual stories

Cons:
- Formspec flows are document- and state-machine-driven, not prop-driven; substantial custom glue needed
- complex journeys (wizard/repeat/validation transitions/event replay) are awkward as stories
- risk of maintaining Storybook abstractions plus separate e2e harness abstractions
- adds dependency and upgrade surface area for capabilities we may not use heavily

### Option B: Custom first-party playground (chosen)

Build a dedicated playground route/app using existing Vite stack and our renderer directly.

Pros:
- exact fit for Formspec primitives (definition/theme/component/mapping/response/validation)
- straightforward integration with existing fixtures and Playwright harnesses
- deterministic controls (clock/seed/locale/timezone) can match conformance requirements
- minimal dependency footprint and no framework impedance mismatch

Cons:
- we own the UI shell and tooling UX
- no ready-made addon marketplace
- requires explicit work for docs/discoverability polish

### Option C: Hybrid (custom runtime + Storybook catalog)

Primary custom playground for runtime behavior, optional Storybook later for static component docs.

Pros:
- best of both worlds if we later need design-system-friendly catalogs

Cons:
- two toolchains and two maintenance surfaces
- premature unless catalog needs become concrete

## 4. Decision

Adopt **Option B** now: build a **custom first-party playground** as the authoritative runtime playground.

Storybook (or another off-the-shelf catalog) is deferred and may be added later only if we have a clear need for component-marketing/docs workflows that the custom playground cannot satisfy economically.

### Reasoning

Formspec’s highest-risk defects are behavioral and cross-document (MIPs, FEL, relevance, submission semantics), not static visual props. A custom playground maps directly to those semantics and can share fixtures and execution patterns with ADR-0021 conformance flows. This gives higher signal per engineering hour than adapting a generic story framework into a stateful form-runtime debugger.

## 5. Decision Details

The playground must treat these as first-class inputs:

- Definition document
- Theme document
- Component document
- Optional mapping document
- Scenario event trace

And expose these as first-class outputs:

- current response payload
- validation report
- engine state/debug view
- deterministic replay log

## 6. Implementation Plan (Phased)

1. **Phase 1: Shell + Fixture Loader**
   - Add a dedicated playground entry (Vite route/app).
   - Load fixture bundles from `tests/e2e/fixtures/*`.
   - Render through `<formspec-render>` with hot reload.

2. **Phase 2: Inspector + Artifact Panels**
   - Add panels for response JSON, validation report JSON, engine diagnostics.
   - Add one-click copy/export for artifacts.

3. **Phase 3: Scenario Replay**
   - Add deterministic replay controls (play/pause/step/reset).
   - Support fixed clock/locale/timezone mode for reproducible runs.

4. **Phase 4: Test Convergence**
   - Ensure Playwright can drive the playground directly for selected conformance checks.
   - Reuse scenario fixtures between manual playground and e2e tests.

5. **Phase 5: Optional Catalog Evaluation (Deferred)**
   - Reassess Storybook (or equivalent) only if static component documentation needs become a bottleneck.

## 7. Consequences

### Positive

- Higher fidelity debugging for spec-level behavior.
- Tighter loop between authoring, runtime diagnosis, and e2e verification.
- Lower dependency and upgrade burden.
- Better alignment with JSON-centric Formspec workflows.

### Negative / Tradeoffs

- We must build and maintain playground UX ourselves.
- Documentation polish features come later unless prioritized.
- No immediate access to off-the-shelf visual addon ecosystem.

## 8. Non-Goals

- Replacing the conformance suite with playground tests.
- Building a public-facing design system showcase in this phase.
- Supporting every external framework integration pattern on day one.

## 9. Revisit Triggers

Re-open this ADR if any of the following occur:

- Team needs a public component catalog with rich docs and design review workflows.
- Custom playground maintenance cost exceeds expected value.
- Off-the-shelf tooling materially improves support for stateful JSON-driven form runtimes.
