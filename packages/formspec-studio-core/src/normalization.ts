 * Conversions applied:
 * - If `definition.instances` is an array, converts to object keyed by each
 *   item's `name` property. The `name` property is stripped from each value.
 * - If `definition.binds` is a non-array object, converts to array of
 *   `{ path, ...config }` entries where each key becomes the `path`.
 *
 * Both conversions are idempotent: calling on already-normalized data is safe.
 *
 * @param definition - The definition to normalize (not mutated; a new object is returned).
 * @returns A new definition with canonical instances and binds shapes.
