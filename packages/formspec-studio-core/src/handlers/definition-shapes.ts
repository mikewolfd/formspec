/**
 * Command handlers for managing definition-level shapes (cross-field validation rules).
 *
 * Shapes are form-level constraints defined in `definition.shapes`. Unlike
 * field-level bind constraints (required, constraint, readonly), shapes
 * express cross-field or form-wide validation rules. Each shape targets one
 * or more fields via a path expression (supporting wildcards like
 * `items[*].field`), contains a FEL constraint expression that must evaluate
 * to true for the form to be valid, and carries a human-readable message
 * with a severity level (`error`, `warning`, or `info`).
 *
 * Shapes can be composed using boolean combinators (`and`, `or`, `xone`,
 * `not`) that reference other shapes by ID, enabling complex validation
 * logic to be built from smaller, reusable rules.
 *
 * Shapes do not affect the component tree layout, so all handlers in this
 * module return `{ rebuildComponentTree: false }`.
 *
 * @module definition-shapes

/**
 * **Command: `definition.addShape`**
 *
 * Appends a new shape (cross-field validation rule) to `definition.shapes`.
 * If `id` is omitted, a unique ID is auto-generated (e.g. `shape_1`).
 * The `target` field is required and specifies which field(s) the shape
 * applies to (supports path wildcards). The `severity` defaults to `'error'`
 * and `message` defaults to an empty string.
 *
 * Optional fields:
 * - `constraint` -- a FEL boolean expression that must be true for validity.
 * - `code` -- a machine-readable error code for programmatic handling.
 * - `activeWhen` -- a FEL boolean expression; the shape only fires when this is true.
 * - `timing` -- when to evaluate: `'continuous'`, `'submit'`, or `'demand'`.
 * - `context` -- a key-to-FEL-expression map providing additional diagnostic data.
 *
 * @param state   - The current project state (mutated in place).
 * @param payload - `AddShapePayload` with required `target` and optional shape properties.
 * @returns `{ rebuildComponentTree: false }` -- shapes do not affect component layout.
