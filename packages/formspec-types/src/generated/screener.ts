 * A standalone Formspec Screener document for respondent classification and routing. A Screener is a freestanding routing instrument — it does not bind to a target Definition. Its relationship to Definitions is expressed entirely through route targets. A Screener declares screening items, binds evaluated in an isolated scope, and an ordered evaluation pipeline with pluggable strategies (first-match, fan-out, score-threshold, or extensions). Evaluation produces a Determination Record capturing matched routes, eliminated routes, scores, inputs with answer states, and evaluation metadata. Lifecycle primitives: availability windows, result validity durations, and evaluation version binding.
